# Derived and reusable data

>Last modified: 04 Apr 2025

All UK LLC researchers are asked to make their research outputs [**available to others**](../../user_guide/TeamDataScience.md) in the TRE. Reusable data are stored in the RETURNED DB schema, and can be requested via the Selection process in [**UK LLC Explore**](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/).

**Datasets created by researchers**  
Documentation and syntax are available in UK LLCâ€™s [**GitHub**](https://github.com/UKLLC/) Repository.  There should be sufficient information in GitHub to determine whether a derived dataset is sufficient for your purposes.  Derived datasets are only available in the TRE and can be requested via [**Explore**](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/) under the RETURNED section. 

**Datasets created by UK LLC**  
UK LLC has created harmonised datasets to facilitate research using multiple LPS. Harmonised variables currently include sex, gender, ethnic group, age, educational attainment, and COVID-19 diagnoses. These have been derived from LPS (self-reported) data, but will be expanded to include linked data. These datasets can be requested from the RETURNED schema in [**Explore**](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/).

**The future**  
As more returned datasets, and reuseable syntax, become available in the TRE, they will be documented in this Guidebook.

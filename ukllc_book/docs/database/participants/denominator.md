# LPS participants included in UK LLC

>Last modified: 01 Apr 2025

UK LLC makes available a number of '**core**' files with each project, including the core '**denominator**' file.  
This file serves as the UK LLC's '**spine**' as it incorporates all participants across all LPS.

Each project in the TRE is automatically provisioned a file named 'CORE_denominator_file1_v0000_YYYYMMDD'.  

The date in the dataset name relates to the "File 1" [**freeze**](../../database/Sample/UKLLC_sample.md) (permissions) that a project is fixed to. Participant permissions are correct and applied to each dataset as of this date, and updated by the LPS on a quarterly basis. 

The core denomininator includes:
* has one row per UK LLC participant 
* inthe name of the LPS to which they belong
* all UK LLC configurable permissions for the different domains of data (e.g. NHS England, place-based). 


The denominator file enables users to:
* calculate linkage rates (when joined to linked datasets)
* contextualise LPS participants within UK LLC in relation to the LPS datasets.

# Dataset structures

>Last modified: 01 Apr 2025

The UK LLC TRE contains a wide-range of datasets, the structures of which are summarised below. More information on individual datasets is available on the summary pages for each data category.

**LPS data**  
Most datasets provided by LPS are in wide format, i.e. there is one row of data per participant. In wide datasets, each column (variable) contains an individual participant's response to a specific question or information about a unique event (e.g., date of birth, blood pressure).

**Linked NHS England (NHSE) data**  
Most datasets provided by NHSE are event-based, with one per row per interaction with an NHS healthcare provider (e.g. GP appointment, repeat prescription). For participant-level research in the TRE, these datasets should be regarded as being in long format, with multiple rows of data (events) per individual.

**Linked Welsh NHS data**  
Data from NHS Wales is likely to be in a similar format to that from NHSE. Details of the dataset structures will be available here as soon as these data are available in the TRE.

**Linked administrative data**  
UK LLC has permissions to link data from some LPS participants to their work, benefits and tax records. Details of the dataset structures will be available here as soon as these data are available in the TRE.

**Place-based data**  
Data about LPS participants' environments (e.g. air pollution, access to greenspace) can be in either wide or long format. This depends on whether data are available for multiple time-points or multiple addresses (long format) or for only a single time-point or address (wide format).

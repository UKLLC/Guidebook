# Non-health administrative data
>Last modified: 03 Jul 2025
<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>UK LLC is working with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to build data pipelines to flow non-health administrative data into the UK LLC Trusted Research Environment (TRE).</strong></div>  
<br>

UK LLC has been approved by the **UK Statistics Authority** as an [**accredited processing environment**](https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/digitaleconomyact-research-statistics/better-access-to-data-for-research-information-for-processors/list-of-digital-economy-act-accredited-processing-environments/) under the **Digital Economy Act (DEA) 2017**. This permits UK LLC to oversee the linkage, matching, curation and de-identification of administrative data; and  the storage and provision of access to de-identified administrative data. **To date, no non-health administrative data has flowed into the UK LLC TRE.** 

As with all data in the TRE, the administrative datasets will be **de-identified** to safeguard Longitudinal Population Studies (LPS) participants' information

>## Linkages:
>* **HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) (LINKAGE APPROVED)**: linkage approved and underway with support from Administrative Data Research UK (ADR UK) and Office for National Statistics (ONS). See the [**HMRC guide**](../linked_admin_data/HMRC_data/) for details of datasets that will be available for request.      
<br>
>* **Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) (LINKAGE APPROVED)**: linkage approved and underway with support from ADR UK and ONS. See the [**DWP guide**](../linked_admin_data/DWP_data/DWP_data.md) for details of datasets that will be available for request.    
<br>
>* **Department for Education (DfE) (DISCUSSIONS ONGOING)**: negotiations are ongoing with DfE - more details will follow in due course. See the [**DfE guide**](../linked_admin_data/DfE_data/) for details of datasets that will be available for request.  
<br>

See the [**Linkages guide**](../Linkages/LPS_linkages.md) for details of which Longitudinal Population Studies (LPS) have permitted linkage of their participants to the HMRC and DWP datasets. We will add information about the DfE datasets in due course. 

>**Note**: Even if an LPS permits linkage to an administrative dataset, the individual participants in that LPS can choose to opt out of UK LLC altogether or to opt out of all or a particular type of  data linkage. If a participant opts out, no new data about them will be shared, but data that has already been provisioned can still be used until the project ends. Please see the [**UK LLC Privacy Notice**](https://ukllc.ac.uk/privacy-policy) for further information.

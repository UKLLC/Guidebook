# Non-health administrative data
>Last modified: 09 Jul 2025
<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>UK LLC is working with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to build data pipelines to flow non-health administrative data into the UK LLC Trusted Research Environment (TRE).</strong></div>  
<br> 

UK LLC has been approved by the **UK Statistics Authority** as an [**accredited processing environment**](https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/digitaleconomyact-research-statistics/better-access-to-data-for-research-information-for-processors/list-of-digital-economy-act-accredited-processing-environments/) under the **Digital Economy Act (DEA) 2017**. This permits UK LLC to oversee the linkage, matching, curation and de-identification of administrative data; and  the storage and provision of access to de-identified administrative data. **To date, no non-health administrative data have flowed into the UK LLC TRE.** 

As with all data in the TRE, the administrative datasets will be **de-identified** to safeguard Longitudinal Population Studies (LPS) participants' information

See the [**Linkages guide**](../Linkages/LPS_linkages.md) for details of which Longitudinal Population Studies (LPS) have permitted linkage of their participants to the HMRC and DWP datasets. We will add information about education data in due course. 

>**Note**: Even if an LPS permits linkage to an administrative dataset, the individual participants in that LPS can object to UK LLC altogether or object to all or a particular type of data linkage. If a participant objects, no new data about them will be shared, but data that has already been provisioned can still be used until the project ends. Please see the [**UK LLC Privacy Notice**](https://ukllc.ac.uk/privacy-policy) for further information.

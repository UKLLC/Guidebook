## PAYE RTI dataset 
The PAYE RTI dataset covers the Pay As You Earn Real Time Information (PAYE RTI) and payment records of the UKâ€™s working population. Variables include pay, tax, national insurance and pension contributions. This dataset will help researchers understand how income affects health, housing and education outcomes and evaluate the impact of policies aligned to these areas.

## SA dataset
The Self-Assessment (SA) dataset contains information about income tax paid by people who are self-employed, i.e. tax is not deducted automatically from wages and pensions. Self-employed people must complete a self-assessment tax return.

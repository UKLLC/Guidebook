Welcome to **UK LLC Guidebook**, the home of UK LLCâ€™s **data documentation** and **user guide**.

UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration (UK LLC) is the **national Trusted Research Environment (TRE)** for the **UK's longitudinal research community**. UK LLC brings together **de-identified data** from **Longitudinal Population Studies (LPS)** and systematically links these data to participants' **health, non-health administrative** (e.g. education, employment, tax and benefits) and **place-based** records in the UK LLC TRE.

[**UK LLC's protocol paper**](https://ijpds.org/article/view/2468/6167), published in the International Journal of Population Data Science, explains how UK LLC works. Currently, researchers can request access to data from **20 LPS**, with participants' records linked to **NHS England** and **place-based datasets**, where permissions allow. We anticipate NHS Wales and further place-based datasets being available in early 2025. 

Please visit [**UK LLC Explore**](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/), UK LLC's metadata catalogue to discover the **breadth of data** held in the UK LLC TRE.

To **apply to access data** please go to [**UK LLC Apply**](https://apply.ukllc.ac.uk/), UK LLC's online application management system.

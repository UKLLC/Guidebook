<br>


[**UK LLC**](https://ukllc.ac.uk/) is the **national Trusted Research Environment (TRE) for data linkage in longitudinal research**. 
UK LLC brings together de-identified data from **Longitudinal Population Studies (LPS)** and systematically links these data to LPS participants' **health**, **non-health administrative** and **place-based** records in the UK LLC TRE. Currently, researchers can request access to data from **more than 20 LPS**, with participants' records linked to [**NHS England**](../docs/linked_health_data/NHS_England/NHSE_intro.md) and [**place-based datasets**](../docs/linked_geo_data/Place_based_intro.md), where permissions allow. Linkage to **NHS Wales** and **non-health administrative** datasets, including HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), is anticipated by the end of 2025. [**UK LLC's protocol paper**](https://ijpds.org/article/view/2468/6167), published in the International Journal of Population Data Science, explains how UK LLC works. 

The purpose of UK LLC Guidebook is to help researchers understand the range of data available and how to work in the TRE.

>## UK LLC's unique attributes include:  
>* **The dynamic nature of linkages.** Linkages to NHS England datasets are refreshed every 6-12 months and we are able to provide researchers with access to new or updated LPS datasets as they become available, ensuring the **temporal alignment** of LPS and linked data.    
<br>
> * **The consistent nature of linkages.** All linkages, data extracts and post-processing are done in the same way, at the same time, across all LPS. This facilitates cross-study analysis as  data are directly comparable.  
<br>
>* **The breadth of data types.** UK LLC already holds NHS England and place-based data. Agreements are in place to flow data from **NHS Wales**, **NHS Scotland**, the Department of Work and Pensions **(DWP)** and HM Revenue and Customs **(HMRC)**. Negotiations are ongoing to flow data from the Department for Education **(DfE)** and Health & Social Care Northern Ireland **(HSCNI)**.  
<br>
>* **The range of linked health records.** UK LLC has the maximum number of variables permitted by NHS England, across a wide range of datasets, covering primary, secondary and community-based care.  
<br>
>* **A dynamic library of research products** (e.g. syntax, derived variables) being developed by UK LLC researchers is available to all TRE users.   
<br>
>* **The simplicity of the application process.** Researchers need to complete just one form to apply for LPS and linked data. Researchers already working in the UK LLC TRE can apply to access additional data as it becomes available, via UK LLC's project amendment process.

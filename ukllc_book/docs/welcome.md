Welcome to **UK LLC Guidebook**, the home of UK LLCâ€™s **data documentation** and **user guide**.

UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration (UK LLC) is the national **Trusted Research Environment (TRE)** for the UK's **longitudinal research community**. UK LLC brings together de-identified data from **Longitudinal Population Studies (LPS)** and systematically links these data to study participants' **health**, **administrative** and **place-based** records in the UK LLC TRE.

[**UK LLC's protocol paper**](https://ijpds.org/article/view/2468/6167), published in the International Journal of Population Data Science, explains how UK LLC works. Currently, researchers can request access to data from **20 LPS**, with participants' records linked to [**NHS England**](../docs/linked_health_data/NHS_England/NHSE_intro.md) and [**place-based datasets**](../docs/linked_geo_data/Place_based_intro.md) where permissions allow. **NHS Wales** and further place-based datasets will be available in 2025.  

UK LLC has several unique attributes that researchers may find advantageous:  
* **The dynamic nature of UK LLC's linkages.** Linkages to NHS England datasets are refreshed every 6-12 months, and we are able to provide researchers with access to new or updated LPS datasets as they become available. (The frequency of other linkage updates will be confirmed as soon as the data are available in the TRE.)  
<br>  
* **The breadth of data types that can be linked to LPS participant's data.** UK LLC already contains NHS England and NHS Wales data, plus place-based data. Agreements are in place to flow data from **NHS Scotland**, from the Department of Work and Pensions **(DWP)**, and from HM Revenue and Customs **(HMRC)**. These data are expected to be available in the TRE in late 2025. Negotiations are ongoing to flow data from the Department for Education **(DfE)** and Health & Social Care Northern Ireland **(HSCNI)**.  
<br>
* **The simplicity of the application process.** Researchers need to complete just one form to apply for any LPS or linked data. Researchers already working in the UK LLC TRE can apply to access additional data as it becomes available, via UK LLC's project amendment process.

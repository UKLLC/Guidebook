# Understanding the harmonisation of LPS highest educational qualification variables
>Last modified: 19 Sep 2025
<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>UK LLC has harmonised data on education for LPS participants and their parents (where available).</strong></div>  

## Introduction  

Qualifications have been standardised to the closest equivalent in the current education system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. These summarised as <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ)</a></strong> levels. Qualifications awarded in Scotland have been harmonised to their equivalents in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  

Where LPS asked participants a single question about their highest qualification, UK LLC uses this answer as the basis of the harmonised variable(s). Some LPS asked a multiple response question about all the qualifications participants had. In these case, UK LLC extracted the highest qualification from the list. 

> N.B. As qualifications have been asked about in different ways, and have changed over time, there is some overlap in the categories used to generate the harmonised variables.  

The qualifications included in each category used by UK LLC are summarised in below.

UK LLC has harmonised data about education into four categories for LPS participants and two categories for participants' parents. These are summarised in Tables 1 and 2. Harmonised education information is provided for each LPS at the most granular level available. 

### Table 1: summary of LPS participants' harmonised education variables  

| llc_educ_1<br>8 categories | llc_educ_2<br>6 categories | llc_educ_3<br>6 categories | llc_educ_4<br>4 categories |

### Table 2: summary of harmonised education variables for LPS participants parent(s)  

|llc_educ_M1<sup>2</sup><br>3 categories | llc_educ_M2<br>3 categories |

**Notes**  
<sup>1</sup> 'NA' refers to participants who returned the questionnaire but did not answe the relevant question(s). Participants not included in the data collection sweep are not included in the harmonised education dataset.  
<sup>2</sup> The '**M**' in the variable name refers to 'mother' and is used where LPS have specifically asked participants about their mother's qualifications. Fathers' qualifications are recorded in the variables suffixed **F1** and **F2**. Where educational information is recorded about either an unspecified parent, or a mother's partner, these are have the suffixes **P1** and **P2**.

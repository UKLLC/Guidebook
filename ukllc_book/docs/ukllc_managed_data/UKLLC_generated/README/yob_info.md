# Understanding the harmonisation of LPS year of birth (age) variables
>Last modified: 25 Jun 2025
<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>UK LLC has harmonised participants' year of birth is recorded across all LPS </strong></div>  

## Introduction  
All LPS contributing to UK LLC have included information about their participants’ age, though this information is collected in a variety of ways:  
* Date of birth
* Self-reported age at a given time point (e.g. completion of a questionnaire)
* Self-reported age range (16-24, 25-49, etc.) at a given time point 

UK LLC has harmonised the age / date of birth data provided by LPS and made it available to researchers as part of the **XXXX** UK LLC managed demographic dataset. This can be requested as part of a project application or amendment. 

>N.B. That some LPS provide data on deceased participants to UK LLC, while some do not. UK LLC uses year of birth as a proxy for age, but it should be noted that a number of these participants may be deceased.

## Harmonisation process
LPS participants' years of birth were calculated in the following ways:
* Date of birth: exact year of birth calculated  
* Age at a given time point: a likely year of birth was calculated based on the date of survey completion
* Age range: an approximate date of birth was calculated assuming participants were at the mid-point of the age range at the time of survey completion
* No age or date of birth (birth cohort studies): a year of birth generated from the year of cohort recruitment (e.g. BCS70, NCDS58)
* No age or date of birth (all other LPS): year of birth recorded as missing


## Full version of the variable [link to dataset page]
The full, harmonised year of birth data forms part of the <span style="color:red">‘full name tbc demog dataset’</span>. It includes a row for every occurrence of a participant’s year being recorded in an LPS dataset in the TRE.

**Missing data are deleted**: this is unlike the other variables in the full, harmonised dataset where missing data are retained. Year of birth is the variable with the highest percentage of missing data <span style="color:red">(CHECK!)</span> (and link to UK LLC profile page) and the inclusion of blank rows adds little to the information available to researchers. (This is in contrast to missing data for sex, gender and ethnic group where a declining to answer could be inferred as a response in its own right.) 

Researchers are encouraged to use the full dataset in the following circumstances:  
* to investigate whether a participant’s self-reported sex has changed over time  
* to ensure that their research uses the definition of sex as recorded at a time point pertinent to the research question


## Reduced version of the variable [link to dataset page]
The reduced, harmonised year of birth data forms part of the <span style="color:red">'reduced name tbc demog dataset’</span>. It includes the most recently available year of birth for each participant as recorded in an LPS dataset in the TRE.  

This dataset forms the basis of the 'year of birth' section of the [UK LLC profile](../../../ukllc_key_facts/Profile/).

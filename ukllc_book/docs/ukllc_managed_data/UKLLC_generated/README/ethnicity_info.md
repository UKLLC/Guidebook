# Understanding the harmonisation of LPS ethnic group variables
>Last modified: 03 Jul 2025
<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>LPS have different approaches to recording participants’ ethnic group, with differing levels of specificity. UK LLC has harmonised data on ethnic group into three, hierarchical, levels</strong></div>  

## Introduction  
The majority of LPS contributing to UK LLC have included some information about their participants’ ethnic group. UK LLC has harmonised the ethnicity data provided by LPS and made it available to researchers as part of the **XXXX** UK LLC managed demographic dataset. This can be requested as part of a project application or amendment. 

Because of the different ethnic groupings used by each LPS, UK LLC has harmonised data about ethnic group into six, five and two categories (summarised in Table 1). Harmonised ethnicity information is provided for each LPS at the most granular level available.

**Table 1: summary of harmonised ethnicity variables**  
| Six categories | Five categories | Two categories |   
|---|---|---|
| White | White | White |
| Black | Black | All other ethnic groups |
| South Asian | Asian | All other ethnic groups | 
| Other Asian | Asian | All other ethnic groups |
| Mixed | Mixed | All other ethnic groups |
| Other | Other | All other ethnic groups |
<br>  

>N.B. The hierarchical nature of the harmonised ethnicity variables ensures that the two category variable and be derived from the five categories, and the five categories from the six.  

The available levels of ethnicity data, and any discrepancies, are summarised in Table 2.

>This [**downloadable spreadsheet**](../../../images/lps_ethnicity_v1.xltm) summarises the ethnic group categories used by each LPS and how these have been harmonised by UK LLC. It also shows how UK LLC has harmonised ethnic categories which do not fit exactly into UK LLC's groupings.

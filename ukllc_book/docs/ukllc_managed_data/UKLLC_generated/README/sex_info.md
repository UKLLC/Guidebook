# Understanding the harmonisation of LPS sex variables
>Last modified: 03 Jul 2025
<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>UK LLC has harmonised how participants' sex is recorded across all LPS </strong></div>  

## Introduction  
All LPS contributing to UK LLC have included information about their participantsâ€™ sex. UK LLC has harmonised the sex data provided by LPS and made it available to researchers as part of the **UK LLC managed** demographic dataset. This can be requested as part of a project application or amendment. 

As many LPS use the terms sex and gender interchangeably, UK LLC has assumed any question about sex or gender refers to sex assigned at birth unless (a) an LPS addressed sex and gender separately, or (b) the catchall question included options such as 'Other'.


>This [**spreadsheet**](../../../images/lps_sex_v1.xltm) shows the gender categories used by each LPS and how these have been harmonised by UK LLC.

N.B. The wording of the sex & gender questions used by **EXCEED**, and deposited in the TRE, imply that EXCEED asks about gender rather than sex. UK LLC has harmonised these variables at face value, though researchers are encouraged to make their own decisions about how to interpret the variables.

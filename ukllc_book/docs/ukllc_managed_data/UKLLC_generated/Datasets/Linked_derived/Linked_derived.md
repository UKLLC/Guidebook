<br>

## Introduction 
UK LLC makes available a number of derived linked datasets. These files contain information that enables researchers to understand their sample and define the denominator for their project. The datasets also enable quicker retrieval of key demographic and **NHS England** service use information. 

## Inclusion criteria
Linked derived datasets containing data derived from **NHS England datasets** are filtered on the LPS selected and approved as part of your research project. In these cases participants are also filtered using the NHS England permissions. Datasets are updated each quarter but researchers' views of these data are 'locked' to permissions at the time of first data provision. The permissions themselves can be found in the UK LLC Study Permissions dataset e.g. 'UKLLC_study_permissions_v0000_YYYYMMDD' formally known as 'CORE_denominator_file1_v0000_YYYYMMDD'.

<br>

## Introduction 
To help researchers understand their sample and define the denominator for their project, UK LLC makes available a number of datasets based on linked data owners' data - the current focus is **NHS England** derived datasets. The datasets also enable quicker retrieval of key demographic and NHS England service use information. 

## Available datasets
All approved research projects are provisioned automatically with the following datasets:
* [Study Permissions](../Linked_derived/study_permissions.md) (linkage permissions for participants)
* [NHSE Patient Service Usage](../Linked_derived/nhse_patient_service_usage.md) (number of times participants have used each NHS England service, including last seen dates)
* [NHSE Patient Demo Mortality](../Linked_derived/nhse_patient_demo_mortality.md) (demographic information and alive/deceased status for participants)
* [NHSE LSOA11 Mappings](../Linked_derived/nhse_lsoa11_dataset_mapping.md) (enables linkage to place-based datasets).

## Inclusion criteria
The linked derived datasets that researchers are given access to are filtered on the LPS selected and approved as part of their research project and then further filtered according to individuals' permissions to link to their health records. Datasets are updated each quarter but researchers' views of these datasets are 'locked' to permissions at the time of first data provision.

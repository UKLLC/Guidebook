## Introduction 
UK LLC makes available a number of derived linked datasets. These files contain information that enables researchers to understand their sample and define the denominator for their project. 
>**Note** UK LLC has not changed the original linked data for these variables.  

Linked derived datasets containing data derived from NHS England datasets are filtered on the LPS selected in the NHS England linked section of the UK LLC data request form. In these cases participants are also filtered using the NHS England permissions. Datasets are updated each quarter but researchers' views of these data are 'locked' to permissions at the time of first data provision. The permissions themselves can be found in the CORE denominator file1 e.g. CORE_denominator_file1_v0001_20220412.

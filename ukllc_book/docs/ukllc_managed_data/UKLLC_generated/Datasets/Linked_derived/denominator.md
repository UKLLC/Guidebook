# Denominator dataset
>Last modified: 23 Jul 2025
<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>UK LLC has created a denominator dataset which serves as the UK LLC 'spine'</strong></div>  
<br>  

The **denominator** dataset incorporates all participants across all LPS. 
Each project in the TRE is automatically provisioned a file named 'CORE_denominator_file1_v0000_YYYYMMDD'.  

The date in the dataset name relates to the "File 1" [**freeze**](../../../../ukllc_key_facts/Sample/UKLLC_sample.md) (permissions) to which each project is fixed. Participant permissions are correct and applied to each dataset as of this date. 

The core denomininator file includes:
* one row per UK LLC participant 
* the name of the LPS to which they belong
* all UK LLC configurable permissions for the different domains of data (e.g. NHS England, place-based). 


The denominator file enables users to:
* calculate linkage rates (when joined to linked datasets)
* contextualise LPS participants within UK LLC in relation to the LPS datasets. 
<br>

UK LLC also provides 'core' datasets based on [NHS England](../../../../linked_health_data/NHS_intro.md) and [place-based data](../../../../linked_geo_data/Place_based_intro.md).

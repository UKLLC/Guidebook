<br>

UK LLC managed datasets fall into two categories:  
* those created by UK LLC
* those created by researchers working in the TRE  

These datasets are available via the <span style="color:red">UKLLC</span> schema in [**Explore**](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/).

**Datasets created by UK LLC**  
UK LLC has created harmonised datasets to facilitate research using multiple LPS. Harmonised variables (derived from LPS data) currently include:
* sex
* gender
* ethnic group
* year of birth  


**Datasets created by researchers**  
Documentation and syntax are available in UK LLCâ€™s [**GitHub**](https://github.com/UKLLC/) Repository.  There should be sufficient information in GitHub to determine whether a derived dataset is sufficient for your purposes.  Derived datasets are only available in the TRE. 


**The future**  
As more returned datasets, and reuseable syntax, become available in the TRE, they will be documented in this Guidebook.  
UK LLC anticipates datasets with information about LPS participants' highest education qualifications to be available later in 2025.

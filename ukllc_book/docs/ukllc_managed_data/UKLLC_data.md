# UK LLC managed datasets

<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>UK LLC curates a range of harmonised and derived datasets</strong></div>  
<br>

These datasets are divided into two categories:  
* those created by UK LLC (available in the <span style="color:red">XXXX schema, with the prefix UKLLC_</span>)
* those created by researchers working in the TRE (available in the <span style="color:red">XXXX schema with the prefix XXXX_</span>)

**Datasets created by UK LLC**  
UK LLC has created harmonised datasets to facilitate research using multiple LPS. Harmonised variables (derived from LPS data) currently include sex, gender, ethnic group and year of birth. These datasets can be requested from the <span style="color:red">XXXX</span> schema in [**Explore**](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/).  


**Datasets created by researchers**  
Documentation and syntax are available in UK LLCâ€™s [**GitHub**](https://github.com/UKLLC/) Repository.  There should be sufficient information in GitHub to determine whether a derived dataset is sufficient for your purposes.  Derived datasets are only available in the TRE and can be requested via [**Explore**](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/) under the <span style="color:red">RETURNED</span> section. 

All UK LLC researchers are asked to make their research outputs [**available to others**](../../user_guide/TeamDataScience.md) in the TRE. Reusable data are stored in the RETURNED DB schema, and can be requested via the Selection process in [**UK LLC Explore**](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/).

**The future**  
As more returned datasets, and reuseable syntax, become available in the TRE, they will be documented in this Guidebook.

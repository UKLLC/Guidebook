# Understanding the harmonisation of LPS gender variables

## Introduction  
Only five of the LPS contributing to UK LLC have included information about their participants’ self-defined gender. UK LLC has harmonised the gender data provided by LPS and made it available to researchers as part of the **XXXX** UK LLC managed demographic dataset. This can be requested as part of a project application or amendment. 

Because of the slightly different gender categories used by each LPS, UK LLC has harmonised data about gender in two ways. Firstly, retaining all the detail provided by each LPS and, secondly, summarising gender information into its simplest form (Table 1). Information on gender is provided for each LPS at the most detailed level available.

**Table 1**
| More detailed | Less detailed |
|---|---|
| Male | Male |
| Female | Female |
| Non-binary | Other |
| Prefer to self-define | Other |  

><font size="1">Note on EXCEED  
>The wording of the sex & gender questions used by EXCEED, and deposited in the TRE, imply that that LPS asks about gender rather than sex. UK LLC has harmonised these variables at face value, though researchers are encouraged to make their own decisions about how to interpret the variables.</font>

This **spreadsheet (link / download??)** shows the gender categories used by each LPS and how these have been harmonised by UK LLC.

## Full version of the variable [link to dataset page]
The full, harmonised gender data forms part of the <span style="color:red">‘full name tbc demog dataset’</span>. It includes a row for every occurrence of a participant’s gender being recorded in an LPS dataset in the TRE.  It is recorded at the most detailed level available for each contributing dataset.

**Missing data are retained** where a participant was included in a data sweep (i.e. other information is available about them in a dataset) but they did not answer the question(s) about their gender. This missing data is separate, and additional, to responses recorded as missing (e.g. 'prefer not to answer', 'no response').

Researchers are encouraged to use the full dataset in the following circumstances:  
* to investigate whether a participant’s self-reported gender has changed over time  
* to ensure that their research uses the definition of gender as recorded at a time point pertinent to the research question


## Reduced version of the variable [link to dataset page]
The reduced, harmonised gender data forms part of the <span style="color:red">'reduced name tbc demog dataset’</span>. It includes the most recently available gender for each participant as recorded in an LPS dataset in the TRE.  Not only is it recorded at the most detailed level available for each contributing dataset (see Table 1), but the less detailed version of the variable has been derived and included in the dataset. A participant for whom gender is available at the more detailed level, thus also has a variable for the less detailed version.

**Missing data have been removed** from the dataset so the only remaining response options are those corresponding to the categories shown in Table 1. This dataset forms the basis of the gender section of the [UK LLC profile](../../../ukllc_key_facts/Profile/).

Researchers are encouraged to use the reduced dataset in the following circumstances:  
* to have the most recent, valid, definition of a participant’s gender 
* to have comparable data on gender for the maximum number of participants (i.e. the less detailed variable is available for all LPS participants for whom any data on gender exists)

>**NOTE**  
>For some variables included in the harmonised datasets, it may be that UK LLC does not have the complete list of response options available to LPS participants. Where this is the case, the absence of a possible option (e.g. ‘prefer not to answer’) from the responses presented does not mean that option was not available to LPS participants. All that can be inferred is that, if that option was available, it was not selected by anyone included in the datasets shared with UK LLC.

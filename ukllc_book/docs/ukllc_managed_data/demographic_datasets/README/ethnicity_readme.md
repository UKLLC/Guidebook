# Understanding the harmonisation of LPS ethnic group variables
>Last modified: 25 Jun 2025
<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>LPS have different approaches to recording participants’ ethnic group, with differing levels of specificity. UK LLC has harmonised data on ethnic group into three, hierarchical, levels</strong></div>  

## Introduction  
The majority of LPS contributing to UK LLC have included some information about their participants’ ethnic group. UK LLC has harmonised the ethnicity data provided by LPS and made it available to researchers as part of the **XXXX** UK LLC managed demographic dataset. This can be requested as part of a project application or amendment. 

Because of the different ethnic groupings used by each LPS, UK LLC has harmonised data about ethnic group into six, five and two categories (summarised in Table 1). Harmonised ethnicity information is provided for each LPS at the most granular level available.

**Table 1: summary of harmonised ethnicity variables**  
| Six categories | Five categories | Two categories |   
|---|---|---|
| White | White | White |
| Black | Black | All other ethnic groups |
| South Asian | Asian | All other ethnic groups | 
| Other Asian | Asian | All other ethnic groups |
| Mixed | Mixed | All other ethnic groups |
| Other | Other | All other ethnic groups |
<br>  

>N.B. The hierarchical nature of the harmonised ethnicity variables ensures that the two category variable and be derived from the five categories, and the five categories from the six.  

This **spreadsheet (link / download??)** shows the ethnic categories used by each LPS and how these have been harmonised by UK LLC. The spreadsheet also shows how UK LLC has harmonised ethnic groupings used by LPS which do not fit exactly into UK LLC's groupings.

## Full version of the variable [link to dataset page]
The full, harmonised ethnicity data forms part of the <span style="color:red">‘full name tbc demog dataset’</span>. It includes a row for every occurrence of a participant’s ethnicity being recorded in an LPS dataset in the TRE.  It is recorded at the most granular level available for each contributing dataset.

**Missing data are retained** where a participant was included in a data sweep (i.e. other information is available about them in a dataset) but they did not answer the question(s) about their ethnic group. This missing data is separate, and additional, to responses recorded as missing (e.g. 'prefer not to answer', 'no response').

Researchers are encouraged to use the full dataset in the following circumstances:  
* to investigate whether a participant’s self-reported ethnic group has changed over time  
* to ensure that their research uses the definition of ethnic group as recorded at a time point pertinent to the research question


## Reduced version of the variable [link to dataset page]
The reduced, harmonised ethnicity data forms part of the <span style="color:red">'reduced name tbc demog dataset’</span>. It includes the most recently available ethnic group for each participant as recorded in an LPS dataset in the TRE.  Not only is it recorded at the most granular level available for each contributing dataset (see Table 1), but lower levels of granularity have been calculated and included in the dataset. A participant for whom ethnic group is available at the most detailed ‘6 categories’ level, thus also has variables for five and two categories.

**Missing data have been removed** from the dataset so the only remaining response options are those corresponding to the three categorical levels outlined in Table 1. This dataset forms the basis of the ethnicity section of the [UK LLC profile](../../../ukllc_key_facts/Profile/).

Researchers are encouraged to use the reduced dataset in the following circumstances:  
* to have the most recent, valid, definition of a participant’s ethnic group 
* to have comparable data on ethnic group for the maximum number of participants (i.e. the two category variable is available for all LPS participants for whom any data on ethnic group exists)
* to be able to compare LPS data with linked data from NHS England, using the <span style="color:red">?CORE? dataset 'new name'</span>

>**NOTE**  
>For some variables included in the harmonised datasets, it may be that UK LLC does not have the complete list of response options available to LPS participants. Where this is the case, the absence of a possible option (e.g. ‘prefer not to answer’) from the responses presented does not mean that option was not available to LPS participants. All that can be inferred is that, if that option was available, it was not selected by anyone included in the datasets shared with UK LLC.

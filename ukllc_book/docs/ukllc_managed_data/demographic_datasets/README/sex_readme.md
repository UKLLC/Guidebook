# Understanding the harmonisation of LPS sex variables
>Last modified: 25 Jun 2025
<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>UK LLC has harmonised how participants' sex is recorded across all LPS </strong></div>  

## Introduction  
All LPS contributing to UK LLC have included information about their participants’ sex. UK LLC has harmonised the sex data provided by LPS and made it available to researchers as part of the **XXXX** UK LLC managed demographic dataset. This can be requested as part of a project application or amendment. 

As many LPS use the terms sex and gender interchangeably, UK LLC has assumed any question about sex or gender refers to sex assigned at birth unless (a) an LPS addressed sex and gender separately, or (b) the catchall question included options such as 'Other'.

><font size="1">Note on EXCEED  
>The wording of the sex & gender questions used by EXCEED, and deposited in the TRE, imply that that LPS asks about gender rather than sex. UK LLC has harmonised these variables at face value, though researchers are encouraged to make their own decisions about how to interpret the variables.</font>

This **spreadsheet (link / download??)** shows the language used by each LPS to describe participants' sex and how these have been harmonised by UK LLC.

## Full version of the variable [link to dataset page]
The full, harmonised sex data forms part of the <span style="color:red">‘full name tbc demog dataset’</span>. It includes a row for every occurrence of a participant’s sex being recorded in an LPS dataset in the TRE.  It is recorded at the most detailed level available for each contributing dataset.

**Missing data are retained** where a participant was included in a data sweep (i.e. other information is available about them in a dataset) but they did not answer the question(s) about their sex. This missing data is separate, and additional, to responses recorded as missing (e.g. 'prefer not to answer', 'no response').

Researchers are encouraged to use the full dataset in the following circumstances:  
* to investigate whether a participant’s self-reported sex has changed over time  
* to ensure that their research uses the definition of sex as recorded at a time point pertinent to the research question


## Reduced version of the variable [link to dataset page]
The reduced, harmonised sex data forms part of the <span style="color:red">'reduced name tbc demog dataset’</span>. It includes the most recently available sex for each participant as recorded in an LPS dataset in the TRE.  

**Missing data have been removed** from the dataset so the only remaining response options are 'Male' and 'Female'. This dataset forms the basis of the sex section of the [UK LLC profile](../../../ukllc_key_facts/Profile/).

Researchers are encouraged to use the reduced dataset in the following circumstances:  
* to have the most recent, valid, definition of a participant’s sex 
* to be able to compare LPS data with linked data from NHS England, using the <span style="color:red">?CORE? dataset 'new name'</span>

>**NOTE**  
>For some variables included in the harmonised datasets, it may be that UK LLC does not have the complete list of response options available to LPS participants. Where this is the case, the absence of a possible option (e.g. ‘prefer not to answer’) from the responses presented does not mean that option was not available to LPS participants. All that can be inferred is that, if that option was available, it was not selected by anyone included in the datasets shared with UK LLC.

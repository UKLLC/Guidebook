# Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)

> Last modified: 10 Jun 2025

## IMD, urban/rural classification and population estimates

This dataset is made up of the following three sources of data: Index of Multiple Deprivation, an Urban-Rural Indicator and Population Estimates.

The Index of Deprivation datsets differ across the 4 UK nations, but each provide small area measures of relative deprivation. Each national index ranks areas from most deprived to least deprived, based on measures of deprivation such as income, education, health and employment.

Urban-Rural classifications also differ across the 4 nations but overall provide an indicator of which areas rural and which are urban based on characteristics such as dwelling densities and distance to major towns and cities.

The National Records of Scotland (NRS), Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) and the Office of National Statistics (ONS) produce national mid-year population estimates. 

This dataset also includes harmonised variables for the [Indices of Multiple Deprivation](https://data.geods.ac.uk/dataset/index-of-multiple-deprivation-imd) and [Urban-Rural classification](https://pages.mysociety.org/uk_ruc/analysis/background_and_analysis.html) across the UK.


## 1. Summary

<details>
<summary> Lower Super Output Area (LSOA), England</summary>

This file contains geographical indicators for each LSOA in England. The indicators include measures of deprivation, population estimates and urban-rural classification. The small area geographies are those developed using the 2011 census.

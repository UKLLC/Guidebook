<summary>Has UK LLC published a protocol paper that can be cited?
</summary>

Yes – in February 2025, UK LLC's protocol was published in the International Journal of Population Data Science: [https://ijpds.org/article/view/2468/6167](https://ijpds.org/article/view/2468/6167).

<summary>Has UK LLC published a data resource profile that can be cited?</summary>

No – UK LLC has not yet published a data resource profile paper. We are waiting for the Scottish and Welsh NHS data and the non-health adminstrative data to flow into the TRE so we can characterise the resource more fully. In the meantime, you can either cite:
(i) the **specific freeze** that underpins the datasets you were provisioned - see [**UK LLC sample**](https://guidebook.ukllc.ac.uk/docs/database/sample/ukllc_sample); or (ii) the **Summary Profile of the UK LLC Resource** that describes freeze 1: Berman S, Evans K, Thomas R, Crane M, McLachlan S, Whitehorn R, Oakley J, Flaig R, Turner E, Boyd A.
Summary Profile of the UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration (UK LLC) Resource. Bristol, UK: UK LLC.

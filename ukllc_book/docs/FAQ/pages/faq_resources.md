<summary>Has UK LLC published a data resource profile that can be cited?</summary>

No – UK LLC has not yet published a data resource profile paper. We are waiting for the Scottish and Welsh NHS data and the non-health adminstrative data to flow into the TRE so we can characterise the resource more fully. In the meantime, you can either cite:
(i) the **specific freeze** that underpins the datasets you were provisioned - see [**UK LLC sample**](https://guidebook.ukllc.ac.uk/docs/database/sample/ukllc_sample); or (ii) the **Summary Profile of the UK LLC Resource** that describes freeze 1: Berman S, Evans K, Thomas R, Crane M, McLachlan S, Whitehorn R, Oakley J, Flaig R, Turner E, Boyd A.

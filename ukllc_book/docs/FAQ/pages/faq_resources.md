<summary>Has UK LLC published a data resource profile that can be cited?</summary>

No – UK LLC has not yet published a data resource profile paper. We are waiting for the Scottish and Welsh NHS data and the non-health adminstrative data to flow into the TRE so we can characterise the resource more fully. In the meantime, you can view the [**UK LLC profile**](../../ukllc_key_facts/Profile/UKLLC_profile.md) which summarises key demographic characteristics of participants in the UK LLC TRE in February 2025. You can cite the **specific freeze** that underpins the datasets you were provisioned - see [**UK LLC sample**](../../ukllc_key_facts/Sample/UKLLC_sample.md).

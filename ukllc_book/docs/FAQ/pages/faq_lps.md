<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>Answers to researchers' questions about working with LPS data.</strong></div style>  
<br>


<details>
<summary>What should I do if I don't use data from an LPS provisioned to my project?</summary>

UK LLC's [**publication policy**](https://ukllc.ac.uk/governance) requires researchers to complete a checklist to confirm which LPS data they used in their research. Before publications are submitted, and at the end of a project, UK LLC will let LPS know whether their data was used in each research project. It is helpful if researchers share their reasons for not using some datasets so UK LLC can share this information with future potential users.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How can I request additional LPS data for my project?</summary>

Requests for new data should be submitted via an amendment to UK LLC. You may apply for additional data from already approved LPS, data from additional LPS, and/or additional linked data.**Note**: each type of data [**amendment**](../../user_guide/RequestingAnAmendment.md)  requires a different level of review before being approved. 
</details>
<details>
<summary>When is more LPS data going to be available via UK LLC?</summary>

UK LLC is currently working with our partner LPS to increase the both the number of datasets, and the number of study participants, included in the UK LLC resource. Information about new datasets will be provided to the UK LLC TRE user group as soon as they become available, and this will be reflected on the [individual LPS pages](../../LPS_data/LPS_introduction.md) in Guidebook and in <strong><a href="https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK LLC Explore</a></strong>, UK LLC's data catalogue.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>What is study ID?</summary>

Each project is allocated a unique individual/participant-level ID system in the form llc_####_stud_id. This ID identifies a participant within an LPS, therefore if a participant exists in more than one LPS their records will exist in the UK LLC twice against 2 different study IDs. Study ID is specific to each project and must not be shared with users outside the project. If a researcher is named on more than one project in the TRE, separate identifiers are attached to each set of datasets relative to each project. Therefore, datasets cannot be combined between projects. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why are there duplicate study IDs in my LPS dataset?</summary>

In most cases LPS data is one row per person. However, there are a few exceptions. Please check the relevant LPS documentation associated with the dataset you are working on.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Are there quirks in some datasets?</summary>

This section is work-in-progress and will be updated as further quirks are brought to our attention – if you identify quirks, please notify the UK LLC Data Team [**support@ukllc.ac.uk**](mailto:support@ukllc.ac.uk)

#### Quirk 1: ncds58_ncds5_mother_child_v0001
Datasets which are >1000 variables wide are split on loading to the UKSERPUKLLC database due to SQL field limit of 1024. Where this is the case the table name will contain a _1_, _2_ etc nested between the version and date in the table name. In most cases the 2 (or more) parts can be merged/joined on LLC_XXXX_stud_id. This can be done when the table has a 1-row per participant structure.   

The following table(s) is/are an exception to this:
* ncds58_ncds5_mother_child_vXXXX_1_YYYYMMDD
* ncds58_ncds5_mother_child_vXXXX_2_YYYYMMDD. 

These data require a join on 2 fields, LLC_XXXX_stud_id and person, because this table is at the child-level whereas the key ID LLC_XXXX_stud_id is at the parent-level.  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can participants be linked between LPS?</summary>

Currently, participants who are in multiple LPS cannot be linked. However, this functionality has been factored into the design of the UK LLC TRE and will be implemented.

<summary>Do LPS have weighting variables in the TRE?</summary>

|ALSPAC|No|Published paper with missing data: [The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children - a resource for COVID-19 research: questionnaire data capture July 2021 to December 2021, with a focus on long COVID](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/8-292). You can also find other papers on the Welcome Open Research site (search for ALSPAC and COVID) that explain how to deal with missing data.|
|BCS70|Yes|Search for weighting variables (e.g. 'design weight') using the Variables search in [Explore](https://ukllc-data-catalogue-96b71e84a70e.herokuapp.com/) and use the Advanced Options to filter on BCS70.|
|BIB|No|The BIB cohort recruited people during pregnancy who attended a 28-week antenatal appointment at the hospital. The aim was to invite all attendees to participate in the BIB cohort. BIB didn’t use any sample frame or weighting during recruitment and the population is broadly representative of people having babies in Bradford during this time. Compared to other LPS in UK LLC, the Bradford cohort falls into the highest deprivation groups and is more ethnically diverse (c. 50% South Asian). |

|EPICN|No|Eligible participants were recruited by post. Individuals were requested to provide detailed dietary, biological and other health data, and to be followed up over a few years, and so the response rate was c. 45%. Therefore participants were not a random population sample, but they were [closely similar to UK population samples](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10466767/) with respect to many characteristics, including anthropometry, blood pressure, and lipids, although with a lower proportion of smokers.|

<br>  

**Applying to UK LLC**  
<details>
<summary>How can I apply to access data in the UK LLC TRE?</summary>

All applications should be made via <a href="https://apply.ukllc.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK LLC Apply</a>, UK LLC's online application service. Further information on the application process is available on Guidebook's ['How do I apply?'](../../../docs/ukllc_key_facts/Applying/Intro.md) page.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I have to be based in the UK?</summary>

Yes, everyone accessing the UK LLC TRE must be based in the UK, and only access the TRE whilst in the UK.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I have to work at a university?</summary>

You do not have to work at a university, but you cannot apply to access the TRE if you work for a commercial organisation. Your employer must be a non-commercial research organisation.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I apply as a Master's or PhD student?</summary>

UK LLC welcomes applications from Master's and PhD students provided that their supervisor is the main applicant. The supervisor must also access the UK LLC TRE so that they can actively supervise the student.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I become an ONS Accredited Researcher (AR)?</summary>

Applications to become an Accredited Researcher should be made via the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/statistics/requestingstatistics/secureresearchservice/becomeanaccreditedresearcher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ONS</a>. To be a full accredited researcher, you must have an undergraduate degree (or higher), including a significant proportion of maths or statistics. Otherwise, you must be able to demonstrate at least three year's quantitative research experience.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>What kind of project can I conduct using the UK LLC resource?</summary>

For an application to be successful, the proposed research must:  
* be in the public good
* have an ethical assessment
* be approved by UK LLC's partner LPS
* align with data owners' specific terms and conditions.  

A list of all projects approved to date is available on the <a href="https://ukllc.ac.uk/data-use-register" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Use Register</a>.

**Accessing the TRE**
<br>
<details>
  <summary>Can I access the TRE from home?</summary>
  
  Yes, as long as you're using a work provided laptop/desktop – see below the user security requirements in the [**Data Access and Acceptable Use Policy.**](https://ukllc.ac.uk/governance/) 

*All UK LLC users must:* 
* *Only access the UK LLC TRE using organisation owned/approved machines, which are automatically maintained so that they are fully patched and up to date with relevant virus protection.* 
* *Only access the UK LLC TRE from the UK and via a secure private or corporate network. Where using a private network, the user must make all reasonable efforts to ensure this is maintained and the equipment is secure (strong password) and kept patched and up to date.*
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I access the TRE from abroad?</summary>
No, you must only access the UK LLC TRE from the UK, in line with the user security requirements detailed in the question above.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>How do I unzip my QR code on a Mac?</summary>

  If you are using a Mac and therefore using “Archive Utility” rather than 7-Zip, you could experience issues. Archive Utility doesn't support the encryption 7zip uses. Therefore we suggest using a different extractor program called [**The Unarchiver**.](https://theunarchiver.com/) 
  </details>
  
<details>
<summary>What should I do if I have forgotten my password for the TRE?</summary>
You can request a new password from SeRP by by entering either your TRE username or email address at: <a href="https://portal.ukllc.ukserp.ac.uk/requestnewpassword" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://portal.ukllc.ukserp.ac.uk/requestnewpassword</a>  
</details>  

<details>
  <summary>What should I do if I can't connect to the TRE?</summary>
Some users may experience a blank screen after logging in. They may also see a message saying the connection has been timed out. This is a known issue with some network configurations. To address this issue, right click before logging into SeRP and you will see two options (VMware Blast and PCoIP). You may find that your home network works better with PCoIP, whereas your organisation network works better with VMware Blast.
</details>

<details>
<summary>For how long can I access the UK LLC TRE?</summary>

UK LLC access is granted for the duration of your project - as stated in your original application - or until your ONS Accredited Researcher status expires. Please note that linked NHS England data can only be accessed for one year at a time. If you wish to extend access, this can be done by submitting an [amendment](../../user_guide/RequestingAnAmendment.md) via **UK LLC Apply**.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I extend my access to the TRE?</summary>

To extend access beyond the agreed project end date, please submit an amendment to the UK LLC Access team. Information on how to submit an amendment is [**here**](../../user_guide/RequestingAnAmendment.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens when my ONS Accredited Researcher (AR) status expires?</summary>
Your access to the TRE will automatically end when your AR status expires. If your project has not reached its end date, and you wish to continue working in the TRE, you should renew your AR status and provide the UK LLC Access team with your new AR number.
 </details>
<br>

**Working in the TRE**
<br>
<details>
<summary>Can researchers work simultaneously in the TRE?</summary>

Yes, researchers can work with their approved project team simultaneously in the TRE. Each project is allocated a project folder, which is a shared area for storing all project-related workings. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can researchers share their screen in online meetings?</summary>

As long as the other researcher(s) is named on your project and has got valid ONS Accredited Researcher status and has completed a Data User Responsibilities Agreement (DURA), then yes, it is OK to share your screen on a conference call so that you can discuss your analyses.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Are there backups of researchers’ files in the TRE and how can I access these?</summary>
 
If you inadvertently delete or overwrite a file you can restore a previous version. To do this right click on the file/folder and choose ‘properties’ and then go to the ‘previous versions’ tab. Choose the version you want to restore.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens if I move organisation while working on a project in the TRE?</summary>

You must submit an amendment to notify UK LLC of a change in employer. Details of how to submit an amendment are available [**here**](../../user_guide/RequestingAnAmendment.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I add a researcher to an existing project in the TRE?</summary>

You must submit an amendment providing details of the new researcher so UK LLC can check whether they and their organisation meet UK LLC's [**access requirements**](https://ukllc.ac.uk/apply). Details of how to submit an amendment are available [**here**](../../user_guide/RequestingAnAmendment.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary>What should I do when a researcher leaves a project?</summary>

You must notify UK LLC when a researcher leaves a project so their access to the TRE can be terminated. This can be done by submitting an [**amendment**](../../user_guide/RequestingAnAmendment.md).
</details>
<br>

**Software in the TRE**  
  <details>
<summary>R helper – which method should I use to pull my data?</summary>

We advise using method A (one table at a time) or B (one LPS/data source at a time) for LPS-collected data. However, we advise using method A only for NHS data because of the size of some of the tables.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is my screen blank in RStudio?</summary>

If you encounter a blank screen when launching RStudio, please refer to this guide to fix the issue: [**https://docs.hiru.swan.ac.uk/display/HDK/RStudio+not+loading**](https://docs.hiru.swan.ac.uk/display/HDK/RStudio+not+loading)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why isn’t Stata opening when I click on Stata files?</summary>

If logging into a fresh desktop, you have to launch Stata from the Windows start menu. It should then ‘deliver’ itself to your desktop and all Stata files should then associate themselves with Stata. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I download Stata packages?</summary>

‘net’ downloads are blocked in the TRE because they require an internet connection. However, Stata package downloads via ssc have been whitelisted and are available. If what you need is not available via ssc you can request a file-in including the .do files using the file-in process. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I download R packages from CRAN?</summary>

Yes, R packages available on CRAN can be installed on SeRP desktops. CRAN is a whitelisted connection for all approved users.
</details>
<br>

**Data in the TRE**


<details>
    <summary>What is study ID?</summary>

Each project is allocated a unique individual/participant-level ID system in the form llc_####_stud_id. This ID identifies a participant within an LPS, therefore if a participant exists in more than one LPS their records will exist in the UK LLC twice against 2 different study IDs. Study ID is specific to each project and must not be shared with users outside the project. If a researcher is named on more than one project in the TRE, separate identifiers are attached to each set of datasets relative to each project. Therefore, datasets cannot be combined between projects. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can participants be linked between LPS?</summary>

Currently, participants who are in multiple LPS cannot be linked. However, this functionality has been factored into the design of the UK LLC TRE and will be implemented.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How much time is required for output clearance?</summary>

Output clearance can take 7-10 working days. We therefore recommend submitting outputs as early as possible and following the [**statisticial disclosure control (SDC) guidance**](../../user_guide/SDC.md) to increase the likelihood of them passing first time. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Is there flexibility in the <10 rule?</summary>

No – due to the variability of statistical disclosure control (SDC) thresholds set by data providers, we are unable to be flexible. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>How can I request additional data for my project in the TRE?</summary>

Requests for new data should be submitted via an amendment to UK LLC. You may apply for additional data from already approved LPS, data from additional LPS, and/or additional linked data. N.B. each type of data [**amendment**](../../user_guide/RequestingAnAmendment.md)  requires a different level of review before being approved. 
</details>  

<details>
<summary>What should I do if I have concerns about data in the TRE?</summary>  

All researchers must contact the Data Team at [**support@ukllc.ac.uk**](mailto:support@ukllc.ac.uk) as soon as possible if they have any concerns that any of the datasets they have access to have NOT been reasonably de-identified or if there are any concerns about the quality of the data.

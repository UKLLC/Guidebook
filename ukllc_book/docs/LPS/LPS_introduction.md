# LPS in the UK LLC partnership

>Last modified: 24 Jul 2024

The UK has a **world-leading portfolio** of around **100 longitudinal population studies (LPS)**, which have collected detailed phenotypic and biological information on over three million members of the UK public. Data collected by LPS include in-depth measures of physical and mental health, lifestyle, environmental and socio-economic measures, alongside biological samples. 

Table 1 provides an overview of the **22 LPS that are part of UK LLC**. Currently data are available for request from 20 of them - data from AIRWAVE and UK-REACH will flow shortly. UK LLC remains open to additional LPS joining the partnership through a formalised onboarding process.

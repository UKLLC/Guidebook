# Available linkages
>Last modified: 26 Jun 2025

<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>See the tables below to understand the linkages and breadth of research topics that each Longitudinal Population Study (LPS) permits.</strong></div>  
<br>

The tables below summarise the **available linkages**. Linkages to Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) and NHS Wales  will be available soon. 

LPS are working to gain the necessary permissions to enable research in the public good (beyond COVID-19). Table 1 shows data available for research in the public good and Table 2 shows data available for COVID-19 research only. We will update Table 1 as more LPS' data becomes available for wider research purposes. 
<br>

>**Note:** Participants can always choose to opt out of UK LLC or specific data linkages. If a participant opts out, no new data about them will be shared, but  data that has already been provisioned, can still be used until the project ends.

## GP data
>**Note:** the linked NHS England GP data [(**GDPPR dataset**)](../linked_health_data/NHS_England/Primary_care_datasets/GDPPR/) can only be used for research relating to COVID-19. For examples of research purposes acceptable to NHS England see the [**COVID-19 Public Health Directions 2020**.](https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/corporate-information-and-documents/directions-and-data-provision-notices/secretary-of-state-directions/covid-19-public-health-directions-2020)

## Account setup
The UK LLC TRE is based on the **SeRP UK infrastructure**. When your project is approved and all paperwork completed, the UK LLC Data Team will provide you with the following information to enable you to set up your account:
* **Username**
* **QR code** for 2-factor authentication (2FA).

Before starting download, or open, a 'One-Time Password' (OTP) app on your smartphone (we recommend FreeOTP), then follow the steps below to **set up your account**:

1.	Navigate to <strong><a href="https://portal.ukllc.ukserp.ac.uk/requestnewpassword" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://portal.ukllc.ukserp.ac.uk/requestnewpassword</a></strong> and enter either your username or email address.
2.	You will receive an email with a link to choose your password. Follow the link and enter your password (twice). **Do not share your password with anyone else**.
3.	Open the OTP app on your smartphone and scan the QR code provided by the UK LLC data team. **Keep the QR code secure and do not share it with anyone else**.
4. In the Yubikey / Mobile Authenticator field, enter the unique 6 digit code generated by the OTP app.
5. Submit the form - your SeRP account is now set up and you are ready to log into the UK LLC TRE.

## First-time login

Follow the steps below to log in:
1.	Using **Google Chrome**, navigate to <strong><a href="https://portal.ukllc.ukserp.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://portal.ukllc.ukserp.ac.uk</a></strong> and enter your username and password.
2. You may need to download **Omnissa Horizon Client** from the right side of the webpage:

8.  Enter your **password**, and a new pop-up appears. Click on the 'UKLLC Standard' icon to launch the SeRP desktop.

9. When you have finished in the UK LLC TRE, **save your work**, select ‘**Options**’ and then ‘**Log off**’ from the top bar menu.  
<div style="background-color: rgb(229, 106, 84); padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>ALWAYS SAVE YOUR WORK ON THE P:\ OR S:\ DRIVE. Once you log off or restart/shutdown the virtual machine you are using, the machine is rebuilt so the majority of the C:\ drive will be wiped.</strong></div>
<br>

## Subsequent log in
Once your account is setup, you can also access the UK LLC TRE **directly via Omnissa**, rather than opening the portal and launching from there. To do this, navigate to **My Computer** and launch **Omnissa Horizon Client**. Click ‘**connect.ukserp.ac.uk**’ and follow the steps 5-8 detailed above.

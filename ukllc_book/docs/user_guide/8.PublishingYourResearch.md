# Publishing or presenting your research
>Last modified: 02 Dec 2024

## Key messages
1. Safeguarding the **anonymity** of LPS participants is of **paramount importance to UK LLC**. Researchers must only include **data in papers/presentations** that have been **approved** through UK LLC's output review process - see [**Moving files in and out guide**](5.MovingFilesInAndOut.md).

3. **All papers and similar outputs** must be **shared with UK LLC for review** prior to submission for publication.

4. **All papers and similar outputs** must be published as **Open Access** in line with [**UKRI Open Access Policy**](https://www.ukri.org/publications/ukri-open-access-policy/). There are two main routes: **gold open access**, published under a Creative Commons CC-BY licence, or **green open access** whereby the author’s accepted version is deposited in an open access repository with a CC-BY license. **University library websites** tend to have really good guidance and many will have grants from funders to pay for gold open access if your research is funded by them, e.g. see [**University of Bath Library**](https://library.bath.ac.uk/open-access/whatisopenaccess), [**University of Bristol Library**](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/staff/researchers/open-access/) or [**University of Edinburgh Library**](https://library.ed.ac.uk/research-support/publish-research/open-access).  

For full details see the [**UK LLC Publication Policy**](https://ukllc.ac.uk/governance).

## General rules
1. All researchers must ensure that their analyses and outputs fall within the **scope** of their approved project and adhere to data owners’ **terms and conditions**.  

2. All researchers must **acknowledge** UK LLC and its partners, collaborators, funders and contributing data owners appropriately. For **presentations**, a selection of slides with acknowledgements and logos is available on the [**UK LLC GitHub**](https://github.com/UKLLC/Materials-for-presentations). For **papers**, detailed information about LPS for supplementary materials is available on the [**Resources for Researchers SharePoint**](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/grp-UKLLCResourcesforResearchers/Shared%20Documents/General/4.%20Publication%20Checklist%20%26%20LPS%20Supplementary%20Info?csf=1&web=1&e=pcoRyJ).

3. **Datasets** from UK LLC’s TRE **cannot be published in public databanks.** If this is requested, we suggest that you provide the following statement: 
*‘Data used in this research are made available via UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration (UK LLC), which is a Trusted Research Environment (TRE) developed and operated by the Universities of Bristol and Edinburgh using an underlying ‘Secure eResearch Platform’ provided by Swansea University. These data cannot be used or shared outside this environment. Researchers can apply to access the UK LLC TRE using the procedure outlined in the [UK LLC Data Access and Acceptable Use Policy](https://ukllc.ac.uk/governance/). UK LLC uses a system of managed open access for researchers who demonstrate their project is intended to improve the public good.’* 

## Rules for presentations
1. UK LLC does **not require** to see presentations before they are delivered.
2. All researchers must **acknowledge** the use and funding of UK LLC’s resource and the collaborative contribution of the LPS and other data owners and partners. A selection of slides with acknowledgements and logos is available on the [**UK LLC GitHub**](https://github.com/UKLLC/Materials-for-presentations)

## Rules for papers and similar outputs
1.	All such outputs must be **shared with UK LLC for review** prior to submission for publication: [**access@ukllc.ac.uk**](mailto:access@ukllc.ac.uk). 
2.	Contributions should be acknowledged using [**ICMJE authorship guidelines**](http://icmje.org/). UK LLC staff, partners and contributing LPS staff are **not expected** to be authors unless they have provided material input and authorship is justified under ICMJE guidelines.
3.	Outputs should be placed into the **public domain** as quickly as possible. UK LLC encourages researchers to use a **preprint server** such as [**medRxiv**](https://www.medrxiv.org/) to make their outputs publicly available while formal peer review is underway.
4.	Outputs must be published as **Open Access**.. 
5.	UK LLC staff **do not** conduct **peer-review** or **scientific assessment**. 
6.	**UK LLC Executive Group** reserves the right to **submit letters or papers** for publication in response to any paper or similar output to explain study procedures or to express an alternative scientific argument.

## Review process
Data owners have **devolved responsibility** for review of manuscripts to UK LLC to minimise the time taken to release findings into the public domain. 

UK LLC will review all manuscripts to check that the **publication checklist is adhered to**, that all manuscripts fall within the **scope** of the approved project, that all parties are accurately **described and acknowledged** and that all project-specific **terms and conditions** have been followed.  

The UK LLC Executive Group may **withhold** the right to publish any manuscript that threatens to bring UK LLC or any of the contributing data owners into **disrepute** or which threatens the **confidentiality of participants**.

Please follow the steps below:
1. Download the **UK LLC Publication Checklist** from the [**Resources for Researchers SharePoint.**](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/grp-UKLLCResourcesforResearchers/Shared%20Documents/General/4.%20Publication%20Checklist%20%26%20LPS%20Supplementary%20Info?csf=1&web=1&e=pcoRyJ)
2. Work through all **UK LLC's conditions**, ticking them off on the checklist as you go. If a journal’s specific formatting requirements prevent fulfilment of a condition, please provide an explanation.
3. For your **supplementary materials** use the document 'Information about LPS for researchers to include in the Supplementary Materials of their publications' available on the [**Resources for Researchers SharePoint.**](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/grp-UKLLCResourcesforResearchers/Shared%20Documents/General/4.%20Publication%20Checklist%20%26%20LPS%20Supplementary%20Info?csf=1&web=1&e=pcoRyJ)
4. Submit your completed checklist, your manuscript and lay summary to [**access@ukllc.ac.uk**.](mailto:access@ukllc.ac.uk) with sufficient time for processing.


UK LLC expects to process all manuscripts within **two weeks of receipt**, but may be able to expedite processing if required. Please note that if there are any substantive changes to the manuscript after UK LLC review, **re-review must be sought**.

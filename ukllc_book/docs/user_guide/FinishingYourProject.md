# Finishing your project
>Last modified: 22 Sep 2025

<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>What to do when your time in the UK LLC Trusted Research Environment (TRE) is coming to an end.</strong></div style>  


## Warning emails that access to TRE is expiring 
You will be emailed **reminders** at approximately 90 days, 30 days and 1 day before your TRE access is due to end. Once the expiry date on your project passes, you will automatically be **locked out of the TRE** and you will  no longer be able to access your project. It is **your responsibility** to choose **one of the two options** listed below with **sufficient time** to carry out the required tasks, i.e. at least **two weeks** before your project's expiry date.  

### Choose your pathway:
* Either [**request an extension**](#1-extend-your-tre-access) to your time in the TRE     
* Or [**wrap up your project**](#2-wrap-up-your-project).  

## 1. Extend your TRE access
If you need additional time to complete your research, you can submit an amendment via <strong><a href="https://apply.ukllc.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK LLC Apply</a></strong>, UK LLC's online application management system. See the [**Requesting an amendment**](../user_guide/RequestingAnAmendment.md#extend-tre-access-period) guide.  

Please note that extending your time in the TRE does not affect your project data which remains static for the duration of the project unless a ['new data'](../user_guide/RequestingAnAmendment.md#request-new-data) amendment is submitted.

## 2. Wrap up your project
1. Submit final [**file outs**](../user_guide/MovingFilesInAndOut.md) required for your **publications or presentations**. Please ensure you adhere to the rules detailed in the [**Publishing or presenting your research guide**](../user_guide/PublishingYourResearch.md).
2. Collate all of your **syntax, derived data** and accompanying **documentation** in your project-specific [**GitLab**](../user_guide/TeamDataScience.md).
3. Share your **syntax** with documentation for integration into the resource, by making a **file-out request** and ticking the box **‘GitHub/Gitlab sharing’**. Approved files will be pushed to the shared subgroup in GitLab called ‘ReadAll’ - see [**Moving files in and out guide**](../user_guide/MovingFilesInAndOut.md). 
4. Push the **approved syntax and documentation** files to your **project repository** on the external public **GitHub** - see [**Using Git guide**](../user_guide/TeamDataScience.md). You must set your UK LLC repository's visibility to **'Public'**
5. Share your **derived data outputs** with documentation for integration into the resource by **emailing** the UK LLC Data Team at [**support@ukllc.ac.uk**](mailto:support@ukllc.ac.uk). Make sure you include the **TRE file path of your data file(s)** - see [**Using Git guide**](../user_guide/TeamDataScience.md).

## Request your access be reinstated
In limited circumstances you can request to have your access to the TRE **reinstated**, e.g. if a reviewer of your manuscript asks you to amend or conduct a further analysis. Please email [**access@ukllc.ac.uk**](mailto:access@ukllc.ac.uk) for advice. If approved, access will be reinstated for the minimum number of researchers on your project and for the minimum duration.

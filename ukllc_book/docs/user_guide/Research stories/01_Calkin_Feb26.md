 Anyone who has ever worked with data collected at different times or using different methods, will know what a challenge it is to bring everything together. One dataset might record age as “date of birth,” another as “age in months,” and a third might group it into five-year bands. 

At UK LLC, with our 100K+ variables provided by 22 Longitudinal Population Studies (LPS), we make standardised (‘harmonised’) variables available, so you can quickly understand the basics of your project data. 

## What is Harmonisation? 
Think of harmonisation as translating multiple data ‘languages’ into one common language. Each LPS has its own way of naming variables, coding responses, and structuring data, all of which may change over time. Harmonisation brings all these languages together so you can compare like with like. 

Of course, some of the details available in the original variables may be ‘lost in translation’, so if you need the full picture, you can always look at the raw data. UK LLC doesn’t change the original data—we simply map it to a shared language. 

## What UK LLC offers 
We provide harmonised variables for the key participant characteristics: sex, gender, year of birth, ethnicity, and education. These are distilled into just two datasets, making it easy to understand the sociodemographic makeup of your participants. For topics such as gender and ethnicity, where there are wide variations in the level of detail collected by LPS, we have generated multiple, hierarchical, variables to reflect these differences. The process is summarised in the chart below.

For transparency, we publish the specifications showing exactly how each source variable is translated into the harmonised structure. You’ll find all the details in UK LLC Guidebook, so you can decide whether to use our harmonised datasets or to generate your own definitions. 

## What are the benefits of using harmonised data? 

* Datasets are ready to use – no need to write code or work out new categories

* Consistency of variables across all partner LPS 

* Transparency of methods, traceable and fully documented in Guidebook 

* All UK LLC’s datasets have a DOI – the harmonised data can be easily referenced 

 ## What’s next? 

As more LPS join UK LLC, and current LPS expand the amount of data shared with UK LLC, we will continue to update these harmonised variables.

### The small print 

As with all data in the UK LLC TRE, projects will only be given access to data from LPS included in the approved project application.  While harmonised datasets cover all LPS where variables exist, you’ll only get data from studies that have approved your project. 

We haven’t changed the original LPS data—harmonised variables are an additional resource. And while we’ve worked hard to capture all relevant variables, some may have been missed. If you spot something missing, please let us know. 

In the chart above, there is a discrepancy between the total number of LPS participants and the number included in the harmonised datasets. This is the result of the inevitable time lag between LPS data being deposited in the TRE and it being harmonised ready for research use.

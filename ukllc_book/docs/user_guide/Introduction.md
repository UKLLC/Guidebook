>Last modified: 20 Jun 2025


Welcome to the **UK LLC TRE user guide**. Here, we provide guidance that should cover all aspects of **working on your project in the TRE**, from first login, working with your approved data, including the available software packages, working with Git, submitting a file out, requesting an amendment, finishing your project and publishing your research. 

Also available is a list of [**FAQs**](https://guidebook.ukllc.ac.uk/docs/faq/faq_intro) that we've compiled from researcher enquiries and a summary of the [**rules**](https://guidebook.ukllc.ac.uk/docs/user_guide/rulesforresearchers) researchers agree to abide by when working in the UK LLC TRE. 

If there are any aspects you feel could be **better explained** or would benefit from **more detail**, please email the UK LLC Data Team at [**support@ukllc.ac.uk**](mailto:support@ukllc.ac.uk). We are committed to making your time in the UK LLC TRE as efficient and productive as possible and very much **welcome feedback from researchers**.

Other useful resources are:
* [**FAQs**](../FAQ/faq_intro.md) that we've compiled from researcher enquiries
* A summary of the [**rules**](../user_guide/RulesForResearchers.md) researchers agree to abide by when working in the UK LLC TRE. 

If there are any topics you feel could be **better explained** or would benefit from **more detail**, please email the UK LLC Data Team at [**support@ukllc.ac.uk**](mailto:support@ukllc.ac.uk). We are committed to making your time in the UK LLC TRE as efficient and productive as possible and very much **welcome feedback from researchers**.

# Finishing your project
## Warning emails that access to TRE is expiring 
You will be emailed reminders from **SeRP UK** at **90 days**, **35 days** and **1 day** before your project's **expiry date**. You will also receive reminders from the **UK LLC Applications Team** at approximately **30 days**, **10 days** and **1 day**.

Once the expiry date on your project passes, you will automatically be **locked out of the TRE** and you will  **no longer be able to log into your project**. It is **your responsibility** to choose **one of the two options** listed below with **sufficient time** to carry out the required tasks, i.e. at least **two weeks** before your project's expiry date.  

## Choose your pathway
1. **Request an amendment** to extend your time in the TRE - see [**Requesting an amendment guide**](#6.RequestingAnAmendment).
2. **Wrap up your project** as detailed below. 

## Wrap up your project

1. Submit **final file outs** required for your **publications/presentations** - see [**Moving files in and out guide**](#5.MovingFilesInAndOut). Please ensure you adhere to the rules detailed in the [**Publishing or presenting your research guide**](#8.PublishingYourResearch).
2. Collate all of your **syntax, derived data** and accompanying **documentation** in your project-specific **GitLab** - see [**Using Git guide**](#4.TeamDataScience).
3. Share your **syntax with documentation** for **integration into the resource**, by making a **file-out request** and ticking the box **‘GitHub/Gitlab sharing’**. Approved files will be pushed to the shared subgroup in GitLab called **‘ReadAll’** - see [**Moving files in and out guide**](#5.MovingFilesInAndOut). 
4. Push the **approved syntax and documentation** files to your **project repository** on the external public **GitHub** - see [**Using Git guide**.](#4.TeamDataScience)

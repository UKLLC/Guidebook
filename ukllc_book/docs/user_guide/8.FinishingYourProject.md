# Finishing your project
>Last modified: 18 Jun 2024

## Warning emails that access to TRE is expiring 
You will be emailed reminders from **SeRP UK** at 90 days, 35 days and 1 day before your project's **expiry date**. You will also receive reminders from the **UK LLC Applications Team** at approximately 30 days, 10 days and 1 day.

Once the expiry date on your project passes, you will automatically be **locked out of the TRE** and you will  no longer be able to log into your project. It is **your responsibility** to choose **one of the two options** listed below with **sufficient time** to carry out the required tasks, i.e. at least **two weeks** before your project's expiry date.  

## Choose your pathway
1. **Request an amendment** to extend your time in the TRE - see [**Requesting an amendment guide**](6.RequestingAnAmendment.md).
2. **Wrap up your project** as detailed below. 

## Wrap up your project

1. Submit final **file outs** required for your **publications/presentations** - see [**Moving files in and out guide**](5.MovingFilesInAndOut.md). Please ensure you adhere to the rules detailed in the [**Publishing or presenting your research guide**](8.PublishingYourResearch.md).
2. Collate all of your **syntax, derived data** and accompanying **documentation** in your project-specific **GitLab** - see [**Using Git guide**](4.TeamDataScience.md).
3. Share your **syntax** with documentation for integration into the resource, by making a **file-out request** and ticking the box **‘GitHub/Gitlab sharing’**. Approved files will be pushed to the shared subgroup in GitLab called ‘ReadAll’ - see [**Moving files in and out guide**](5.MovingFilesInAndOut.md). 
4. Push the **approved syntax and documentation** files to your **project repository** on the external public **GitHub** - see [**Using Git guide**.](4.TeamDataScience.md)
4. Share your **derived data outputs** with documentation for integration into the resource by **emailing** the UK LLC Data Team at [**support@ukllc.ac.uk**](mailto:support@ukllc.ac.uk). Make sure you include the **TRE file path of your data file(s)** - see [**Using Git guide**.](4.TeamDataScience.md)

## Request your access be reinstated
In certain circumstances you can request to have your access to the TRE **reinstated**, e.g. if a reviewer of your manuscript asks you to amend or conduct a further analysis. Please email [**access@ukllc.ac.uk**](mailto:access@ukllc.ac.uk) for advice. If approved, access will be reinstated for the minimum number of researchers on your project and for the minimum duration.

<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>Researchers must send all papers and similar outputs to UK LLC for review before submitting them for publication.</strong></div style>


## Key messages for researchers
1. You must only include **data** in papers/presentations that have been **approved** through UK LLC's output review process - see [**Moving files in and out guide**](../user_guide/MovingFilesInAndOut.md).

2. You must ensure that your analyses and outputs fall within the **scope** of your approved project and adhere to data owners’ **terms and conditions**.

3. You must **acknowledge** UK LLC and its partners, collaborators, funders and contributing data owners appropriately. For **presentations**, an acknowledgement slide containing logos is available [**here**](../images/UKLLC_Acknowledgement_Slide_Publication%20Checklist_v4.pptx). For **papers**, detailed information about LPS for supplementary materials is available in DOC-DAT-032 [**here**](../images/DOC-DAT-032_UKLLC_LPS_Supplementary_Info_V1.9.docx).

4. You must share **all papers and similar outputs** with **UK LLC for review** prior to submission for publication (UK LLC does **not require** to see your **presentations** before they are delivered).

6. You should place your research findings into the **public domain** as quickly as possible. UK LLC encourages researchers to use a **preprint server** such as <strong><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">medRxiv</a></strong> to make your outputs publicly available while formal peer review is underway.

7. You must publish **all papers and similar outputs** as **Open Access** in line with <strong><a href="https://www.ukri.org/publications/ukri-open-access-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UKRI Open Access Policy</a></strong>. There are two main routes: **gold open access**, published under a Creative Commons CC-BY licence, or **green open access** whereby your accepted version is deposited in an open access repository with a CC-BY licence. **University library websites** tend to have really good guidance and many will have grants from funders to pay for gold open access if your research is funded by them, e.g. see <strong><a href="https://library.bath.ac.uk/open-access/whatisopenaccess" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Bath Library</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/staff/researchers/open-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Bristol Library</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://library.ed.ac.uk/research-support/publish-research/open-access" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Edinburgh Library</a></strong>.

8. If you are requested to write a **data availability statement**, we suggest you provide the following:
*‘Data used in this research are made available via UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration (UK LLC), which is a Trusted Research Environment (TRE) developed and operated by the Universities of Bristol and Edinburgh using an underlying ‘Secure eResearch Platform’ provided by Swansea University. These data cannot be used or shared outside this environment. Researchers can apply to access the UK LLC TRE using the procedure outlined in the <strong><a href="https://ukllc.ac.uk/governance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK LLC Data Access and Acceptable Use Policy</a></strong>. UK LLC uses a system of managed open access for researchers who demonstrate their project is intended to improve the public good.’*

For further details see the <strong><a href="https://ukllc.ac.uk/governance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK LLC Publication Policy</a></strong>.

## Sending your manuscript to UK LLC for review
Data owners have devolved their responsibility for review of manuscripts to UK LLC to minimise the time taken to release findings into the public domain.

At least **two weeks prior to journal submission**, you must email your **manuscript**, **lay summary** and **completed publication checklist** (available [**here**](../images/DOC-ISM-041_UKLLC_PublicationChecklist_V1.8.docx)) to [**access@ukllc.ac.uk**](mailto:access@ukllc.ac.uk) for approval by UK LLC. We expect to process all manuscripts within **two weeks of receipt**. Please note that if there are any substantive changes to the manuscript after UK LLC review, re-review must be sought.

UK LLC reviews all manuscripts to check that they fall within the **scope** of the approved project, that all parties are accurately **described and acknowledged** and that all data owners' **terms and conditions** have been followed. You can view your project-specific terms and conditions in <strong><a href="https://apply.ukllc.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK LLC Apply</a></strong>. UK LLC staff **do not** conduct **peer-review** or **scientific assessment**. UK LLC staff, partners and contributing LPS staff are **not expected** to be authors unless authorship is justified under [**ICMJE authorship guidelines**](http://icmje.org/).

The UK LLC Executive Group can withhold the right to publish any manuscript that may bring UK LLC or any of the contributing data owners into disrepute or which could compromise the confidentiality of LPS participants. They also reserve the right to **submit letters or papers** for publication in response to any paper or similar output to explain study procedures or to express an alternative scientific argument.

### Completing the publication checklist

1. Download the **UK LLC Publication Checklist** from [**here.**](../images/DOC-ISM-041_UKLLC_PublicationChecklist_V1.8.docx)

2. Work through all **UK LLC's conditions**, ticking them off on the checklist as you go and providing an explanation if need be.
3. For your **supplementary materials** use the document DOC-DAT-032 'Information about LPS for researchers to include in the Supplementary Materials of their publications' available [**here.**](../images/DOC-DAT-032_UKLLC_LPS_Supplementary_Info_V1.9.docx)
4. Submit your completed **checklist**, **manuscript** and **lay summary** to [**access@ukllc.ac.uk**.](mailto:access@ukllc.ac.uk) with sufficient time for processing.

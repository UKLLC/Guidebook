# Requesting an amendment
>Last modified: 04 Jul 2025

<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>This guide explains how to request an amendment to your project.</strong></div style>  
<br>

## Types of amendments
Amendments to projects fall into the following **five** categories:
1.	Request new data. 
2.	Add/remove a researcher. 
3.	Move organisation. 
4.	Extend TRE access period. 
5.	Change research question. 

## Apply for an amendment
1. All amendments must be submitted via [**UK LLC Apply**](https://apply.ukllc.ac.uk/), UK LLC's online application management system. 
2. **Log into your account**, go to your project and choose the amendment type(s) you would like to apply for. 
3. **Complete all sections**.
4. Submit your amendment. 

If you have any queries regarding amendments, email the UK LLC Applications Team: [**access@ukllc.ac.uk**](mailto:access@ukllc.ac.uk). 

Your request will be reviewed by the UK LLC Applications Team and if you are requesting new data, input may also be sought from the **UK LLC Data Access Committee** (DAC) and individual **LPS DACs**.  

Each **approved** amendment is indicated by an **increment to the letter** appended to the project reference number, e.g. llc_0006_a is the original approved application for project llc_0006 and llc_0006_b is the first approved amendment.

UK LLC **informs the LPS** of all amendments to projects that involve their data and **informs the UK Statistics Authority** of amendments to projects that use the **Digital Economy Act** as their legal gateway to access non-health administrative data.

The **length of the approval process** varies depending on the **type** of amendment and the associated due diligence requirements.

Specific information about each type of amendment is detailed below.

## 1. Request new data
You can request access to additional data from **already approved LPS**, and/or access to data from **additional LPS**, and/or access to additional linked data. Each type of data amendment requires a different level of review as detailed below:

1.	**Additional data** from **previously approved LPS**:  
a)	Standard sensitivity data - review by UK LLC  
b)	Elevated sensitivity data - review by LPS DACs  
c)	Derived data - review by LPS DACs.

2.	Data from **new LPS** - review by LPS DACs (if the data are linked then review also by UK LLC Linked Data Review Panel).  

3.	**Additional linked data** - review by LPS DACs & UK LLC Linked Data Review Panel.

UK LLC checks that the request for new data falls within the **scope** of the approved project. If the request falls outside the scope, the research team is invited to submit a **new application**.   
 
## 2. Add/remove a researcher
### Add a researcher
**Note**: UK LLC does **not** need to be notified about new collaborators on a project who will **not access the TRE**.   

You can submit an amendment before the new researcher has created an account in [**UK LLC Apply**](https://apply.ukllc.ac.uk/) but please note the amendment will not be reviewed until the new researcher has added all mandatory details and uploaded a CV. The UK LLC Applications Team checks the **suitability** of the new researcher and their research organisation, including their **Accredited Researcher status**. If the researcher is from an organisation already involved in the project, the new researcher need only complete a UK LLC **Data User Responsibilities Agreement (DURA)**, but if they come from a new organisation, a **Data Access Agreement (DAA)** between their organisation and the University of Bristol (owner of UK LLC) will need to be implemented. 

### Remove a researcher
You must **notify UK LLC** via an amendment when a researcher **leaves** a project so that their access to the TRE can be terminated.

## 3. Move organisation
You must **notify UK LLC** via an amendment when a researcher **moves organisation** so that the UK LLC Applications Team can check the **suitability** of the **new organisation**, including its information security credentials. If the researcher moves to an organisation not yet covered by a DAA for the project, a new **DAA** will be required.

## 4. Extend TRE access period
Researchers are sent **reminders** at approximately 90 days, 30 days and 1 day that their access to the TRE is coming to an end. If you anticipate requiring **more time** in the TRE to complete your analyses, you must **notify UK LLC** via an amendment. The UK LLC Applications Team assesses whether the extension request is **reasonable and realistic**, and whether the Accredited Researcher status of each researcher surpasses the new requested project end date. For researchers whose Accredited Researcher status falls short, extension to the TRE is set to the expiry date of their status. 

## 5. Change research question
All your analyses must lie within the **scope** of your original approved project. If you feel that your research question is shifting or you would like to amend your research question, you must submit an amendment. The UK LLC Applications Team will determine if the amended or new research question would require a **new lay summary**. If so you will be invited to submit a **new application**.

## Types of amendments
Amendments to projects fall into the following **five** categories:
* [Request new data](#request-new-data)
* [Add or remove a researcher](#add-or-remove-a-researcher)
* [Move organisation](#move-organisation)
* [Extend TRE access period](#extend-tre-access-period)
* [Change research question](#change-research-question)

Each of these is described separately below.

## How to apply for an amendment
* All amendments must be submitted via <strong><a href="https://apply.ukllc.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK LLC Apply</a></strong>, UK LLC's online application management system.
* Log into your account, go to your project and choose the amendment type(s) you would like to apply for.
* Complete all sections.
* Submit your amendment.

> If you have any queries regarding amendments, email the UK LLC Applications Team: [**access@ukllc.ac.uk**](mailto:access@ukllc.ac.uk).

Your request will be reviewed by the UK LLC Applications Team and, if you are requesting new data, input may also be sought from the **UK LLC Data Access Committee** (DAC) and individual **LPS DACs**.

UK LLC **informs LPS** of all amendments to projects that involve their data and **informs the UK Statistics Authority** of amendments to projects that use the **Digital Economy Act** as their legal gateway to access non-health administrative data.

The **length of the approval process varies** depending on the type of amendment and the associated due diligence requirements.  

Each **approved** amendment is indicated by an **increment to the letter** appended to the project reference number. E.g. for project llc_0006, the original approved application is llc_0006_a and the first approved amendment is llc_0006_b.

Specific information about each type of amendment is detailed below.

## Request new data
You can request access to additional data from **LPS previously approved** for your project, to access data from **additional LPS**, and/or to access **additional linked data**.  
Each type of data amendment requires a different level of review as detailed below:

1.	**Additional data** from **previously approved LPS**:  
a)	Standard sensitivity data - review by UK LLC  
b)	Elevated sensitivity data - review by LPS DACs  
c)	Derived data - review by LPS DACs.

2.	Data from **additional LPS**:  
a) Review by LPS DACs  
b) Review also by UK LLC Linked Data Review Panel if the data are linked.

3.	**Additional linked data**:  
a) Review by LPS DACs & UK LLC Linked Data Review Panel.

UK LLC checks that any request for new data falls within the **scope** of the approved project. If the request falls outside the scope of the project, the research team is invited to submit a **new application**.

## Add or remove a researcher
### Add a researcher
> Note: UK LLC does not need to be notified about new collaborators on a project who will not access the TRE.

A new researcher must create an account in [**UK LLC Apply**](https://apply.ukllc.ac.uk/). You can submit an amendment before the new researcher has created an account but the amendment will not be reviewed until the new researcher has added all mandatory details and uploaded a CV. The UK LLC Applications Team checks the **suitability** of both the new researcher, including their **Accredited Researcher status**, and their research organisation.  
If the researcher is from an organisation already involved in the project, the new researcher need only complete a UK LLC **Data User Responsibilities Agreement (DURA)**, but if they come from a new organisation, a **Data Access Agreement (DAA)** between their organisation and the University of Bristol (owner of UK LLC) will need to be implemented.

### Remove a researcher
You must **notify UK LLC** via an amendment when a researcher **leaves** a project so that their access to the TRE can be terminated.

## Move organisation
You must **notify UK LLC** via an amendment when a researcher **moves organisation**. The UK LLC Applications Team will check the **suitability** of the **new organisation**, including its information security credentials. If the researcher moves to an organisation not yet covered by a DAA for the project, a **new DAA** will be required.

## Extend TRE access period
Researchers are sent **reminders** at approximately 90 days, 30 days and 1 day that their access to the TRE is coming to an end. If you anticipate requiring **more time** in the TRE to complete your analyses, you must **notify UK LLC** via an amendment. The UK LLC Applications Team assesses whether the extension request is **reasonable and realistic**, and whether the Accredited Researcher status of each researcher extends beyond the new requested project end date. For researchers whose Accredited Researcher status falls short, any extension of their TRE access is set to the expiry date of their status.  

> **Note**  
> If your time in the TRE is extended, your data will **not be updated** to reflect changes in participants' consent status since the project was originally provisioned. Projects remain tied to their original [**'freeze'**](../../docs/ukllc_key_facts/Sample/UKLLC_sample.md) unless new data (i.e. data that were not available when the original application was submitted) is requested via an amendment.

## Change research question
All your analyses must lie within the **scope** of your original approved project. If you feel that your research question is shifting or you would like to amend your research question, you must submit an amendment. The UK LLC Applications Team will determine if the amended or new research question would require a **new lay summary**. If so you will be invited to submit a **new application**.

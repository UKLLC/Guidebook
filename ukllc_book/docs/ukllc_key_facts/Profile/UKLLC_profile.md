# UK LLC Profile
>Last modified: 25 Jun 2025
<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>A summary of the demographic characteristics of LPS participants included in the UK LLC TRE</strong></div>  

## Introduction  
The below table is drawn from two sources:  
* [harmonised] demographic variables created by UK LLC
* demographic information provided by NHSE (Link to 'core' datasets?)

> **Notes**  
>* For clarity, all missing data has been grouped into a single category
>* Where participants have demographic data recorded in both LPS datasets and NHS England datasets, it is assumed that LPS (self-reported) data is more accurate
>* The 'best measure' value is based on LPS data where available, infilled with NHS England data

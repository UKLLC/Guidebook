To ensure the appropriate and fair use of LPS participants’ information, UK LLC operates a rigorous multi-stage <strong><a href="https://ukllc.ac.uk/apply" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">application assessment process</a></strong>. All applicants and
their applications are assessed against the <strong><a href="https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/help/secure-lab/what-is-the-five-safes-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Five Safes’ Framework</a></strong> to determine whether they meet the requirements and commitments agreed with participants of LPS and data owners. See the <strong><a href="https://ukllc.ac.uk/governance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK LLC Data Access and Acceptable Use Policy</a></strong> for further information.


##  Researcher requirements

> Researchers must be:
>* Based in the UK.
>* An Office for National Statistics (ONS) <strong><a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/statistics/requestingstatistics/secureresearchservice/becomeanaccreditedresearcher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accredited Researcher</a></strong>.
>* Part of a non-commercial research organisation.

**Note**: UK LLC accepts applications from **PhD students** on condition that the main applicant supervises them closely.

## Application requirements
> Applications must:
> * Be in the **public good** - UK LLC currently follows the <strong><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1124013/NDG_public_benefit_guidance_v1.0_-_14.12.22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Data Guardian (NDG) guidance</a></strong><sup>1</sup> to assess public good.
> * Have an ethical assessment.
> * Be approved by partner LPS and other data owners.
> * Align with data owners' specific terms and conditions.

<sup>1</sup>UK LLC is working with its public contributors to develop a context-specific public good definition which will replace our use of the NDG definition - we will update this page in due course.

To ensure the appropriate and fair use of LPS participants’ information, UK LLC operates a rigorous multi-stage [**application assessment process**](https://ukllc.ac.uk/apply). All applicants and 
their applications are assessed against the [**‘Five Safes’ Framework**](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/help/secure-lab/what-is-the-five-safes-framework/) to determine whether they meet the requirements and commitments agreed with participants of LPS and data owners. See the [**UK LLC Data Access and Acceptable Use Policy**](https://ukllc.ac.uk/governance) for further information.  


##  Researcher requirements

> Researchers must be: 
>* Based in the UK.

>* Part of a non-commercial research organisation.  
<br>

**Note**: UK LLC accepts applications from **PhD students** on condition that the main applicant supervises them closely.  

## Application requirements
> Applications must:
> * Be in the **public good** - UK LLC currently follows the [**National Data Guardian (NDG) guidance**](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1124013/NDG_public_benefit_guidance_v1.0_-_14.12.22.pdf)<sup>1</sup> to assess public good.

<sup>1</sup>UK LLC is working with its public contributors to develop a context-specific public good definition which will replace our use of the NDG definition - we will update this page in due course.

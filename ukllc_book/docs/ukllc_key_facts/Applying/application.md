<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>When your EoI is approved you can complete your full application in UK LLC Apply.</strong></div>
<br>

Your full application comprises up to **three** sections: 

- application form
- data request
- codelist (if you are applying to access certain NHS England datasets - see below)

## 1. Complete your application form
Log into [**UK LLC Apply**](https://apply.ukllc.ac.uk/) and complete the following sections (you can save your application and come back to it at your convenience):  
- Project overview
- Methodology
- Benefits and public involvement
- Funding
- Lawful basis
- Ethics
- Data
- Setting
- Outputs.

A pdf of the application form is available [**here**](../../images/Application_Form_Template_20250128.pdf).

In particular, please take into consideration these following **key points**:

### a) Co-applicants 
You can invite **co-applicants** to work with you on your application, but these should **only** be researchers who will be **accessing data** in the UK LLC TRE. If you deem it absolutely necessary to invite a co-applicant to help you develop your application, but this person won't be accessing the TRE, please restrict these co-applicants to one or two at the most. 

>- There can be only **one main applicant** per application  
>- 	Only the main applicant can **submit** the application  
>-  A PhD student can **not** be the main applicant.  
 

### b) Ethics
You must have obtained a **favourable opinion** from an **independent** Research Ethics Committee (REC) if you are applying to access data of **elevated sensitivity** and/or if you are using **novel** or **contentious** research methods (see definitions below). 

Otherwise, you will be asked to fill in the **Ethics Self-assesment Tool** developed by the UK Statistics Authority. The form can be downloaded from within [**UK LLC Apply**](https://apply.ukllc.ac.uk/) or here: [LINK]. Once completed, please upload your form to the Ethics section of your application. Your ethical assessment will be reviewed and depending on the outcome, you may need to contact your institutionâ€™s REC for further advice.

>**Data of elevated sensitivity**:  
>- mental health 
>- sexual health 
>- drug and alcohol misuse 
>- assisted pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, pregnancy in age <16 years 
>- abuse 
>- self-harm
>- suicide.  
<br>  

>**Novel or contentious research methods**:
>- entirely novel or not commonly used methods
>- any artificial intelligence (AI) methods.  
<br>

### c) Public and Participant Involvement and Engagement (PPIE)
All applications approved by UK LLC must be for the **public good**. You can find the definition for public good [**here**](https://guidebook.ukllc.ac.uk/docs/ukllc_key_facts/eligibility/eligibility). We strongly encourage you to think about and develop **PPIE plans** that cover the duration of your project (from developing research ideas to discussing results and dissemination). This is **obligatory** for projects involving data of elevated sensitivity and novel/contentious research methods.
To understand how UK LLC assesses public good, please see [**UK LLC Data Access Public Review Panel Public Good Considerations**.](../../images/Public-Good-Considerations_v1.pdf)

## 2. Complete your data request
Go to [**UK LLC Explore**](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/) to build your data request. Select all the datasets you require by ticking a box next to the dataset name. All datasets are clustered according to the **schema** to which they belong, e.g. PLACE refers to place-based datasets, MCS refers to Millennium Cohort Study datasets. Then go to **Selection** and press **Save** - this will download a data_selection.csv file which you then upload in the Data section of your application. 


## 3. Complete your codelist
If you have selected any of the following six **NHS England** datasets you must complete a codelist: 
- CANCER (Cancer Registrations)
- GDPPR (General Practice Extraction Service (GPES) Data for Pandemic Planning and Research) 
- HESAE (Accident & Emergency)
- HESAPC (Admitted Patient Care)
- HESOP (Outpatients)
- PCM (Primary Care Medicines).

(HES: Hospital Episode Statistics)

To download the **UK LLC codelist template** and for guidance on completing your codelist, please see the [**Codelists and NHS England data guide**](../../linked_health_data/NHS_England/Coding/codelists.md). When you've completed your codelist, upload it in the Data section of your application.

## Application review
Your application will undergo **internal** and **external** review. You will be notified of the progress of your application - please see the [**How your application is reviewed guide**](../Applying/review.md) for further information.

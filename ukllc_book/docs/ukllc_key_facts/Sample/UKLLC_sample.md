# UK LLC sample
>Last modified: 03 Jul 2025
<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>The UK LLC Trusted Research Environment (TRE) contains data about >400,000 participants from >20 different LPS. We call this pooled population the UK LLC sample. </strong></div>  
<br>


>##  Summary: 
>* The UK LLC sample is **complex and dynamic** because: (i) Each Longitudinal Population Study (LPS) provides information to UK LLC on a sub-set of their participants; (ii) The sample provided by each LPS will change as new participants join or some withdraw consent to be included in different linkages and/or the UK LLC as a whole; and (iii) New LPS may join UK LLC and some LPS may withdraw from UK LLC.   
<br>
>* Changes to the UK LLC sample occur in a controlled manner **every quarter** when LPS are required to communicate any changes to their LPS sample.   
<br>
>* Following updates to the UK LLC sample, UK LLC establishes a **‘data freeze’** which comprises a number of tables that summarise the broad characteristics of the UK LLC sample at that point in time.   
<br>
>* Data freezes are critical in helping researchers to understand the UK LLC sample that **underpins the datasets** at the point in time they are granted access to them.  
<br>
>* Each data freeze will be given a **Digital Object Identifier (DOI)** and all data tables are retained to help track changes to the UK LLC sample and to promote reproducibility of analyses.  
<br>

**Note**: LPS can update or submit datasets at any time and if these occur between data freezes, the information presented in the tables will not reflect these changes. 

Please  visit the individual **Freeze pages** to understand the current UK LLC sample and to see how the sample has changed over time.

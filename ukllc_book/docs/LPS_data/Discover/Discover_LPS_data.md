# Discover LPS data

<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>Various online resources provide information about the data held by Longitudinal Population Studies (LPS).</strong></div>
<br>

## Discover LPS data in the UK LLC TRE
See the [**LPS in the UK LLC partnership guide**](../LPS_introduction.md) for a list of all the LPS that contribute data to the UK LLC TRE. Elsewhere in Guidebook you can access information about each LPS and their available datasets. The [**Permitted linkages guide**](../Linkages/LPS_linkages.md) summarises which LPS are linked to which routine records.

If you want to see greater detail (variable names, labels and values) and **build a data request**, go to [**UK LLC Explore**](https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/).

## Discover additional LPS data
Not all partner LPS have uploaded all their data into the UK LLC TRE yet. You can find information about the total data held by LPS by searching LPS documentation resources (see <strong><a href="https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK LLC Explore</a></strong> for links). You may also find the following **discovery tools** useful:

- <strong><a href="https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catalogue of Mental Health Measures</a></strong>: this catalogue provides detailed information about LPS mental health data over time. The curators have identified which LPS have used which measures to assess mental health. There is a broad range of information within the scope of 'mental health', e.g. substance use relating to smoking, alcohol and drugs. **When this is useful**: to understand the use of specific mental health measures at different time points and across LPS. **Coverage**: the catalogue includes most UK LLC partner LPS, but the scope of metadata is limited to describing data with ‘mental health’ relevance.
- <strong><a href="https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLOSER Discovery</a></strong>: this is a very detailed database of variable names, labels and values, including summary value frequencies. It is structured to allow users to understand how variables fit within an overarching ‘sweep’ of data collection (e.g. a questionnaire or assessment visit). **When this is useful**: to understand data sequences within assessments and for testing feasibility using summary value frequencies. **Coverage**: seven UK LLC partner LPS (ALSPAC, BCS70, Millennium Cohort, NCDS58, Next Steps, NHSD46, Understanding Society).
- <strong><a href="https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK Data Service</a></strong>: this catalogue contains LPS-produced documentation for the deposited data, including what data was collected, how it was collected and how it was subsequently quality assessed and processed. **When this is useful**: to understand how LPS collected and processed their data. **Coverage**: eight UK LLC partner LPS (BCS70, ELSA, Millennium Cohort, NCDS58, Next Steps, NHSD46, NICOLA, Understanding Society).
- <strong><a href="https://www.healthdatagateway.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HDR UK Gateway</a></strong>(): this database provides metadata about LPS and also about linked routine records, particularly the different NHS datasets. **When this is useful**: for signposting the availability of LPS datasets and to provide links to more detailed documentation. **Coverage**: many UK LLC partner LPS have individual Gateway entries and these are linked to from the <strong><a href="https://healthdatagateway.org/en/collection/98" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK LLC entry</a></strong>. The metadata tends to be at the LPS level rather than the dataset level.
- <strong><a href="https://harmonydata.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harmony</a></strong>: this AI-driven tool enables users to upload lists of LPS variables (e.g. PDFs or Excel spreadsheets) and to identify which questions are similar within the LPS over time or across LPS. It facilitates, but does not conduct, data harmonisation. **When this is useful**: to rapidly and automatically identify potentially comparable variables. **Coverage**: Harmony works for any metadata and is not restricted to any specific LPS.

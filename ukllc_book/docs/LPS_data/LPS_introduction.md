# LPS in the UK LLC partnership
>Last modified: 19 Jun 2025

<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>The UK has a world-leading portfolio of around 100 Longitudinal Population Studies (LPS), which have collected detailed phenotypic and biological information on over three million members of the UK public. </strong></div>  
<br>

## Introduction  
Data collected by LPS include in-depth measures of physical and mental health, lifestyle, environmental and socio-economic measures, alongside biological samples. 

Table 1 provides an overview of the **>20 LPS that are part of UK LLC**. UK LLC remains open to additional LPS joining the partnership through a formalised onboarding process.

Most LPS have published **cohort profiles** which give detailed information about each LPS - to access these, click on the cohort information in Table 1 about each LPS (some publications may require library licences to access, but most will be free and publicly accessible).

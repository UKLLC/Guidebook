# Available linkages

>Last modified: 18 Jun 2025

The table below summarises the **linkages permitted** by each LPS to **health**, **non-health administrative** (His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)) and **place-based datasets**.

**Note:** Even if an LPS has permitted linkage to a data source, each **LPS participant** can decide to **opt out of UK LLC** altogether or to **opt out of a specific linkage or all linkages** by notifying their LPS. If a participant opts out, no further data about them will flow into the UK LLC TRE and the participant’s data will not be provisioned to new research projects. However, researchers who already have access to that individual’s information will be permitted to retain that access until the end of the project, but they will not obtain any new data about that individual.

## Any pubic good research (including COVID-19 specific):

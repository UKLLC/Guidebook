# Energy Performance Certificates

> Last modified: 10 Dec 2024

## Introduction
 An Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) provides information on the energy efficiency of a building providing detailed (from most efficient band A to least efficient band G) including average energy efficiency ratings, energy use, carbon dioxide emissions, fuel costs, average floor area sizes and numbers of certificates recorded. Available since 2008, an EPC is required when a building is constructed, sold or let and it is valid for 10 years. This dataset provides the EPCs including 52 variables on the characteristics of domestic properties in England and Wales.

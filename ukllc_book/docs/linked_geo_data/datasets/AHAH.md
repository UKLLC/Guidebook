## Introduction

AHAH (the index of ‘Access to Health Assets and Hazards’) is a multi-dimensional index developed by the Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) for Great Britain measuring how ‘healthy’ neighbourhoods are. The AHAH index combines indicators under four different domains of accessibility: Retail environment (access to fast food outlets, pubs, tobacconists, gambling outlets), Health services (access to GPs, hospitals, pharmacies, dentists, leisure services), Physical environment (Blue Space, Green Space - Passive), and Air quality (NO₂, PM10, SO₂). Measurement data and deciles for the overall index, 4 domains and 14 inputs are produced for Lower Level Super Output Areas (LSOAs) for England and Wales, and Data Zones (DZ) for Scotland. Distances shown for some of the measurement data are means of the time (in minutes) for driving by car along the established road network, between the population weighted centroid of each postcode contained within each statistical geographical unit, and the actual location of the outlet/service.

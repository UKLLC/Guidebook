## Introduction 

UK LLC environmental datasets refer specifically to the 'physical environment', including climate, topography, structures and landscape.

In an age where humans are transforming large aspects of their environments, there is an ever-increasing overlap between the natural world and that created by humans [Bartuska, 2007](https://www.academia.edu/download/57001646/The_Built_Environment__A_Collaborative_Inquiry_Into_Design_and_Planning__2nd_Edi__2007.pdf#page=51). Consequently, UK LLC provides linked datasets that cover both the built and natural environment. 

The datasets have been split into the following categories:
- [Neighbourhood](../environmental_datasets/neighbourhood_datasets/neighbourhood.md)
- [Property](../environmental_datasets/property_datasets/property.md)
- [Pollution](../environmental_datasets/pollution_datasets/pollution.md)

**Please click on each category for more information.**

Linked environmental data can support the investigation of the health and social impacts of a participant's surroundings and help inform policy relating to, for example, suitable housing provision, transition to net-zero climate targets and promoting healthy lifestyles.

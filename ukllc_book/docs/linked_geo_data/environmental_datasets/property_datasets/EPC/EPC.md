>Last modified: 16 Jun 2025

<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>UK LLC provides Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) data for domestic properties in England and Wales, detailing energy efficiency (bands Aâ€“G), carbon emissions, fuel costs, floor area and other property characteristics.</strong></div>  
<br>

An Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) contains information on the energy efficiency of a building (from most efficient band A to least efficient band G). The energy performance records also contain a detailed breakdown of energy use, carbon dioxide emissions, fuel costs, average floor area sizes and numbers of certificates recorded. Available since 2008, an EPC is required when a building is constructed, sold or let and it is valid for 10 years. This dataset provides the EPCs including 54 variables on the characteristics of domestic properties in England and Wales.

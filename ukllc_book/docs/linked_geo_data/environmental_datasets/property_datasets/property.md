# Property datasets

## Introduction

UK LLC property datasets relate to the building in which a participant lives and allow us to improve our understanding of housing quality, property attributes and property sales.

Socioeconomic status is a long-established population health risk factor. Studies have found associations between socioeconomic status and mortality, respiratory diseases, chronic
diseases, obesity levels, oral health and health-related behaviours such as smoking and alcohol consumption. While education, income and occupation have traditionally been used as indicators of socioeconomic status, other research has represented socioeconomic status in terms of housing tenure, housing type, number of bedrooms, overcrowding measures and asset measures ([Coffee et al., 2013](http://www.ij-healthgeographics.com/content/12/1/22)). 

Property datasets can also be used to investigate the impact of housing conditions on health. Exposure to poor housing conditions (such as inadequate heating and damp) has been found to be linked to physical health conditions such as increasing the risk of respiratory infections, asthma and tuberculosis ([Bonnefoy et al., 2003](http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/IJEP.2007.014819); [Shaw, 2004](http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.25.101802.123036); [Walker et al., 2006](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/cki186)). Studies ([Curl et al., 2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jech-2014-204064) ; [Pevalin et al., 2017](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2017.09.020)) have found that housing quality is also linked to mental health with factors such as tenure type moderating the effects of persistent poor housing on mental health.

The UK LLC's property datasets can also be used for research that can help inform policy relating to suitable housing provision and transition to net-zero climate targets (e.g. heating financial support, indoor air quality, privacy and transition to energy-saving ways of living). 

The current UK LLC property datasets include:

# Air pollution NOx, NO2 and O3


>Last modified: 06 Jun 2025

<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong> </strong>UK LLC provides high-resolution national exposure surfaces for NO₂ and O₃ in England and Wales.</div>  
<br>

## Hybrid Air Dispersion Exposure System (HADES) 

The exposure surfaces were created using the HADES: Hybrid Air Dispersion Exposure System modelling framework, which combines dispersion modelling with satellite-derived estimates of background concentrations, land cover, and a 3-D representation of buildings, in a statistical calibration framework. 

These datasets contain national-scale outdoor nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) exposure surfaces for England and Wales in 2018, 2019, and 2020 at very high spatial resolutions (10m and 100m). Participants residential addresses or postcodes are linked to one of the 10m x 10m cells. These exposures are also summarised for the 2021 UK Census communities in England and Wales using area-weighted sampling (i.e., zonal average). These values represent community background exposures for Census Output Area (COA), Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) and Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA).  

Modelling explained 77-79% for NO2 and 87-89% for O3 of the variability in hourly-annual average concentrations and was robust to changes in NOx emissions during the COVID pandemic. 

## 1. Summary 

<details>
  <summary>Household level, England and Wales</summary>

HADES is a national-scale model of outdoor air pollution model that was developed for the rapid production of concentration maps of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) at very high spatial resolution (10m). Residential addresses are linked to one of the 10m x 10m cells. This returns 9 annual (3 pollutants x 3 years) and 216 hourly-annual average (3 pollutants x 3 years x 24 hours) exposure values at each location.

  <summary>Census Output Area (COA) level - Yearly, England and Wales</summary>

  HADES is a national-scale model of outdoor air pollution model that was developed for the rapid production of concentration maps of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) at very high spatial resolution (10m). This dataset represents community background exposures for Census Output Area (COA) communities across England and Wales.

  <summary>Lower Layer Super Output Area level (LSOA), England and Wales</summary>

  HADES is a national-scale model of outdoor air pollution model that was developed for the rapid production of concentration maps of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) at very high spatial resolution (10m). This dataset represents community background exposures for Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) level communities across England and Wales.

  <summary>Middle Layer Super Output Area level (MSOA), England and Wales</summary>

  HADES is a national-scale model of outdoor air pollution model that was developed for the rapid production of concentration maps of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) at very high spatial resolution (10m). This dataset represents community background exposures for Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA) level communities across England and Wales.

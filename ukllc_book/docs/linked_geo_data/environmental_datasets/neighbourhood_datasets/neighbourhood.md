# Neighbourhood datasets

## Introduction 

UK LLC neighbourhood datasets cover the natural, built and social environment surrounding a participant's residential address.

While there is no single generalisable definition of a 'neighbourhood', [Suttles (1972)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.178.4060.494) has suggested that neighbourhoods exist at three
different scales, each having its own predominant purpose or function (Table 1). [Suttles' (1972)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.178.4060.494) work can be used to suggest that a neighbourhood extends from 
the smallest unit of neighbourhood (‘home area’, which is typically defined as an area within 5–10 minutes' walk from home) to the largest unit, which is the urban district/region (covering the wider landscape of social, and economic opportunities).

| Scale                 | Predominant Function                        | Mechanism(s)                                  |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Home area            | Psycho-social benefits (e.g., identity, belonging) | Familiarity and Community                                   |
| Locality             | Residential activities                      | Planning, Social status and position, Service provision, Housing market |
| Urban district/region| Landscape of social and economic opportunities | Employment connections, Leisure interests, Social networks |

As suggested by [Kearns and Parkinson (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00420980120087063), in the 'Scales of Neighbourhood', each of the scales can actually perform all of the functions, therefore the distinctions between the scales represent general themes rather than strict categories. In a similar light, the UK LLC neighbourhood datasets are not confined to a specific geographic unit or scale (e.g. Address or Lower Super Output Area) but rather cover the themes of:
- Service provision
- Leisure activities
- Planning
- Housing market

The current UK LLC neighbourhood datasets include:

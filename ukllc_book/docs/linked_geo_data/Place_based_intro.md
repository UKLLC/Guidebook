# Place-based datasets

> Last modified: 20 Feb 2025

## Introduction 

Place-based data can be linked to participants using address data provided by Longitudinal Population Studies (LPS) or linked area indicators (e.g. Lower Super Output Area, LSOA) in participants’ NHS records. All geographic identifiers in the UK LLC TRE below the region/devolved nation level are encrypted.

## UK LLC documentation of place-based datasets 

The place-based datasets cover a variety of domains and time periods as summarised in Table 1. Their geographic coverage varies per dataset based on availability across the four UK nations. Further details including external links to publications and metadata are available in the individual dataset guides. 

Note: 

Researchers never access participants’ address data – the only location variables in the clear in the UK LLC TRE are English region (e.g. South West England) or devolved nation (e.g. Scotland). 

Place-based data can be linked using LPS-provided address data or linked area indicators (e.g. LSOA, which is in participants’ NHS records). 

All address data are sent by the LPS to our trusted third party – NHS Digital Health and Care Wales (DHCW). This address data is only used for place-based linkage and geocoding subject to [individual LPS approval](https://guidebook.ukllc.ac.uk/docs/lps/linkages/lps_linkages).

We are currently in the process of adding new place-based datasets into the TRE. If you require a specific dataset or require additional variables in an existing dataset to provide a higher level of granularity, please contact support@ukllc.ac.uk. 

Please note that bespoke place-based datasets might incur a cost.

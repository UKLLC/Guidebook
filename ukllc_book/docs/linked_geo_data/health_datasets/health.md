# Place-based health datasets

> Last modified: 27 Jun 2025

## Introduction 

UK LLC place-based health datasets cover areas such as life expectancy, inequalities, disability and addiction. These health datasets are not at participant level but rather, each data owner has developed and released them at a specified geographic unit e.g. Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) level. 


**We will be adding place-based datasets soon**

# Place-based health datasets

> Last modified: 25 Jun 2025

## Introduction 

UK LLC place-based health datasets cover areas such as life expectancy, inequalities, disability, addiction as well as food insecurity. These health datasets are not at participant level but rather, each data owner has developed and released them at a specified geographic unit such as Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) or Data Zone (DZ) level. 




**We will be adding place-based datasets soon**

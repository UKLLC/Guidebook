# Place-based health datasets

> Last modified: 27 Jun 2025

## Introduction 

UK LLC place-based health datasets cover areas such as life expectancy, inequalities, disability, addiction as well as food insecurity. These health datasets are not at participant level but rather, each data owner has developed and released them at a specified geographic unit e.g. Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) level. 

Existing research that has linked Longitudinal Population Study data with area level health data include [Richardson et al.'s (2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829214001282?casa_token=n_0fSy52_0AAAAAA:kQieI47Wm2irlOk_eYgBhIk_DNLtXP1Zyo6wan2PSES6e7LvmVuWt-uxTiKwKG_gJpFdaTpg) research which found that peole living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods had less variety in away-from-home eating options compared to those living in advantaged neighbourhoods. They suggested that disadvantaged populations may be at higher to buy the abundant cheap and convenient food retail options that are high in calories, fat, and sugar. 


**We will be adding place-based datasets soon**

# Place-based health datasets

> Last modified: 27 Jun 2025

## Introduction 

UK LLC place-based health datasets cover areas such as life expectancy, inequalities, disability and addiction. These health datasets are not at participant level but rather, each data owner has developed and released them at a specified geographic unit, such as the Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) level. 


**Place-based health datasets will be added soon.**

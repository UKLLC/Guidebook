## Introduction

UK LLC mobility datasets will include indicators of how people move and interact with their environment, for example, walkability metrics, driving and public transport use.

Understanding human mobility is important for research relating to, for example, public health, epidemic control, and urban planning (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.79.016111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ni and Weng, 2009</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/BigData.2016.7840811" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zhao et al., 2016</a>).

Existing research linking longitudinal population study data to mobility datasets has included investigation into the relationship between street connectivity, residential density and land use with walking for transport by utilising linked datasets such as distance to nearest transport station (<a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/abs/10.1289/EHP2080" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bentley et al., 2018</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2019.11.006" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gao et al., 2019</a>). Other research has linked to walkability data in order to investigate the relationship with participants' health such as cardiometabolic risk factors (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2016.02.006" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Braun et al., 2016</a>).


**Mobility datasets will be added soon.**

# Townsend Deprivation Index 


>Last modified: 09 Jun 2025

## Townsend Index 

The Townsend index [(1989)](https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003368885) is a relative indicator of material deprivation, which has been widely used to identify socio‐economic confounding in crime, education, and health research in England. This dataset is a 2021 version of the Townsend Index (Jephcote and Gulliver, [2025](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27073906)). 

## 1. Summary 

<details>
  <summary> Census Output Area (COA) level, England and Wales</summary>

This deprivation index is constructed from four unweighted UK Census variables, which describe the level of total unemployment, overcrowding, private vehicle ownership, and home ownership in each community.

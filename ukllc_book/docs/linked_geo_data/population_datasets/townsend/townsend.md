## Townsend Index 

The Townsend index [(1989)](https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003368885) is a relative indicator of material deprivation, which has been widely used to identify socio‚Äêeconomic confounding in crime, education, and health research in England. This dataset is a 2021 version of the Townsend Index (Jephcote and Gulliver, [2025](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27073906)).

## IMD, urban/rural classification and population estimates

<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 178, 169, 0.3); padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;"><strong>UK LLC provides a dataset containing UK-wide harmonised measures of indices of multiple deprivation, an urban-rural indicator and population density.</strong></div>

This dataset is made up of the following three sources of data: Index of Multiple Deprivation, an Urban-Rural Indicator and Population Estimates.

The Index of Deprivation datasets differ across the four UK nations, but each provide small area measures of relative deprivation. Each national index ranks areas from most deprived to least deprived, based on measures of deprivation such as income, education, health and employment.

Urban-Rural classifications also differ across the four nations but overall provide an indicator of which areas rural and which are urban based on characteristics such as dwelling densities and distance to major towns and cities.

The National Records of Scotland (NRS), Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) and the Office of National Statistics (ONS) produce national mid-year population estimates. 

This dataset also includes harmonised variables for the [Indices of Multiple Deprivation](https://data.geods.ac.uk/dataset/index-of-multiple-deprivation-imd) and [Urban-Rural classification](https://pages.mysociety.org/uk_ruc/analysis/background_and_analysis.html) across the UK.


## 1. Summary

<summary> Lower Super Output Area (LSOA), England</summary>

This file contains geographical indicators for each LSOA in England. The indicators include measures of deprivation, population estimates and urban-rural classification. The small area geographies are those developed using the 2011 census.

## 4. Change Log 

We are currently working on a change log which will show changes to the dataset’s metadata. 

## 5. Documentation 

We are currently building a documentation storage system which will host relevant and useful documents related to datasets, groupings, and studies themselves. 

## 6. Useful Syntax

The [**UKLLC_nhse_lsoa11_dataset_mapping**](../../../ukllc_managed_data/UKLLC_generated/Datasets/Linked_derived/nhse_lsoa11_dataset_mapping.md) dataset can be linked to **PLACE_IMD_XXX_v0000_YYYYMMDD** to add in geographical indicator variables associated with encrypted LSOA11 (lsoa11cd_e) from health records
 
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland each have their own Index of Multiple Deprivation dataset.

To link **UKLLC_nhse_lsoa11_dataset_mapping_v0000_YYYYMMDD** with 
**PLACE_IMD_england_v0000_YYYYMMDD**:

1. Retrieve data from database via [**helper syntax**](../../../user_guide/UsingSoftware.md)
2. Link datasets on the *lsoa11cd_e* field. Example of STATA syntax linking to England:

```
* load NHSE lsoa11 dataset
use “S:\LLC_9999\data\stata_w_labs\UKLLC_nhse_lsoa11_dataset_mapping_v0000_YYYYMMDD.dta”, clear

* merge in IMD
merge m:1 lsoa11cd_e using “S:\LLC_9999\data\stata_w_labs\PLACE_IMD_england_v0000_YYYYMMDD.dta”

*drop geographical units not linked to any participant health record 
drop if _merge == 2
```
**UKLLC_nhse_lsoa11_dataset_mapping** is a long dataset typically with millions of rows, depending on size of data request. It is therefore recommended that you subset both or either of these datasets before linking/processing/saving. An example of this would be to select the quintile from the **Index of Multiple Deprivation** that you are going to use and keep these variables only. This will ensure the dataset size remains as manageable as possible. It is also advised to only link to the country/ countries that you require.

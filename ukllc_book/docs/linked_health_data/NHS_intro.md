## Permitted linkages

* **NHS England** and **NHS Wales**: participants are linked to their English and Welsh health records (where permissions are in place). 

* **NHS Scotland**: an agreement has been signed with Public Health Scotland and data are anticipated to flow into the UK LLC database in early 2026.

* **Northern Ireland**: negotiations are ongoing with Health & Social Care Northern Ireland (HSCNI).

## UK LLC documentation of NHS datasets
We have organised our NHS data documentation by nation. Within each nation we have included the following:
* A summary of the **datasets** we hold for each nation.
* A summary of the **restrictions** to use of the datasets.
* A summary of the **temporal coverage** of the datasets.
* An explanation of how LPS participants are **linked** to their health records and how they can **opt out**.
* A summary of the various classification or **coding systems** used by each nation. 
* Multiple **groupings guides** that summarise the datasets that belong to the same domain, e.g. mental health datasets, hospital datasets. 
* Multiple **individual guides** that provide details about each of the datasets, e.g. Hospital Episode Statistics Outpatients.

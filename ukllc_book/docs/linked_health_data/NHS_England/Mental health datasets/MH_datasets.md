>## Summary:
>* UK LLC holds **two NHS England mental health datasets**: [**Mental Health Services Data Set (MHSDS)**](../Mental%20health%20datasets/MHSDS/MHSDS.ipynb) and [**NHS Talking Therapies for Anxiety and Depression (IAPT)**](../Mental%20health%20datasets/IAPT/IAPT.ipynb).
<br>
>* **MHSDS** represents **secondary care** services that record data after a referral is made to a specialist mental health team. These services support individuals with severe or complex mental health conditions such as psychosis, bipolar disorder, gambling, eating disorders and learning disabilities.
<br>
>* **IAPT** covers **primary care** services designed to help people with mild to moderate mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression. 
<br>
>* MHSDS is primarily a dataset for administrative purposes. It is comprised of approximately 60 datasets and is particularly complex. UK LLC is collaborating with experts within the community to improve documentation for researchers – please see our detailed [**Understanding MHSDS guide**](../Mental%20health%20datasets/MHSDS/Understanding_MHSDS.md), which will be updated periodically.
<br>
>* The MHSDS and IAPT datasets are increasingly using clinical terminology to capture clinical information, primarily through SNOMED-CT. See the [**Coded variables guide**](../Coding/coding_intro.md) for further details.

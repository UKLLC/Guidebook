# Maternity Services Data Set (MSDS)
## Introduction  
**MSDS data have not yet flowed into the UK LLC TRE**. We will update this documentation in due course.

The MSDS collects data about all **NHS funded maternity care** in **England**. The starting point for inclusion in the dataset is the formal antenatal booking and the end point is when the mother is discharged from maternity services, which is typically 10 days after discharge from hospital.

The dataset provides information about the mother’s demographics, booking appointments, admissions and re-admissions, screening tests, labour and delivery, along with the baby’s demographics, admissions, diagnoses and screening tests. 

Further information about the **data collected** is available here: [**https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-collections-and-data-sets/data-sets/maternity-services-data-set/guidance/general-msds-guidance**](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-collections-and-data-sets/data-sets/maternity-services-data-set/guidance/general-msds-guidance)

The MSDS uses SNOMED, ICD-10 and OPCS-4. See the [**Coded variables guide**](../Coding/coding_intro.md) for further details.

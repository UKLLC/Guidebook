# Demographics dataset  
>Last modified: 19 Jun 2024

The Demographics dataset is derived from the [**Personal Demographics Service (PDS) database**](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/personal-demographics-service), which is the national database of all **NHS patients** in **England, Wales** and the **Isle of Man** in or after **2004**. People born in these areas are registered and issued an NHS number at birth; people moving into these areas are registered when they first interact with an NHS care setting. Data collected include NHS numbers and basic **demographic details** such as date of birth, name, sex and address. The PDS does not hold any clinical information. NHS healthcare professionals use the PDS to accurately identify patients so they can find their correct medical records.

The [**National Back Office (NBO)**](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-back-office-for-the-personal-demographics-service) provides a **data quality service** for the Personal Demographics Service. 

Further information to be added in due course.

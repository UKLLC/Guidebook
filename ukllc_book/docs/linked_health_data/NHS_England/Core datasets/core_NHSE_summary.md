# NHS England core datasets

>Last modified: 14 Feb 2025

## Overview
UK LLC makes available a number of standard ‘**core**’ NHS England files with each project. These files contain information that enables researchers to understand their sample and define the denominator for their project. 

Currently, the following NHS England core datasets are available:

* **NHSD presence**
* **NHSD derived indicator**

**OVERVIEW TABLE TO BE ADDED SHORTLY** 

## Permissions and data refreshes
Core datasets containing data derived from NHS England datasets are filtered on the LPS selected in the NHS England linked section of the UK LLC data request form. In these cases participants are also filtered using the NHS England permissions. Core datasets are updated each quarter but researchers' views of these data are 'locked' to permissions at the time of first data provision. The permissions themselves can be found in the CORE denominator file1 e.g. CORE_denominator_file1_v0001_20220412.

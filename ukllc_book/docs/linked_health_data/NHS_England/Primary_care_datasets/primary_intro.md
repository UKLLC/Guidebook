# NHS England primary care datasets
>Last modified: 20 May 2025
## Introduction
The two primary care datasets currently available in the UK LLC TRE are:
* Primary Care Medicines (PCM)
* General Practice Extraction Service (GPES) Data for Pandemic Planning and Research [**(GDPPR)**](../Primary_care_datasets/GDPPR/GDPPR.ipynb)


A summary of the **PCM dataset**, including coverage, restrictions on use and representation of LPS, is provided elsewhere in Guidebook [(PCM)](../Other%20datasets/PCM/PCM.ipynb).
<br>Further information about **GDPPR** is below, with summary metrics on the next page [(GDPPR)](../Primary_care_datasets/GDPPR/GDPPR.ipynb).

## The GDPPR dataset
Researchers are permitted access to the GDPPR dataset under specific terms set by NHS England:
1. Research must be related to **COVID-19**. For examples of research purposes acceptable to NHS England see the [**COVID-19 Public Health Directions 2020**.](https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/corporate-information-and-documents/directions-and-data-provision-notices/secretary-of-state-directions/covid-19-public-health-directions-2020#:~:text=identifying%20and%20understanding)
2. The GDPPR dataset must **not** be used for any form of performance management of General Practices.

>## Summary:
>* UK LLC holds **two NHS England primary care datasets**: [**General Practice Extraction Service (GPES) Data for Pandemic Planning and Research (GDPPR)**](../Primary_care_datasets/GDPPR/GDPPR.ipynb) and [**Primary Care Medicines (PCM)**](../Primary_care_datasets/PCM/PCM.ipynb).
<br>
>* The **PCM dataset** is also known as **Medicines dispensed in Primary Care NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) dataset**.
<br>
>* Researchers are permitted access to the GDPPR dataset under two **specific terms** set by NHS England: 1. Research must be related to **COVID-19**. For examples of research purposes acceptable to NHS England see the [**COVID-19 Public Health Directions 2020**.](https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/corporate-information-and-documents/directions-and-data-provision-notices/secretary-of-state-directions/covid-19-public-health-directions-2020#:~:text=identifying%20and%20understanding) 2. The GDPPR dataset must **not** be used for any form of performance management of General Practices.
<br>
>* The GDPPR dataset spans **1940s onwards** and the PCM dataset **2015 onwards**.
<br>
> * Both the GDPPR and PCM datasets use primarily **SNOMED CT codes**. See the [**Coded variables guide**](../Coding/coding_intro.md) for further details.


## Overview of primary care datasets
For further information see the **individual dataset guides.**

**Information about code clusters are available online:**
* The full list of code clusters can be explored via an NHS England dashboard: [**Microsoft Power BI**](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMjY4OTRhNmUtZDdiMy00NzVhLTkzMmMtZmRhMzAyOWFkZjc4IiwidCI6IjM3YzM1NGIyLTg1YjAtNDdmNS1iMjIyLTA3YjQ4ZDc3NGVlMyJ9).
* The individual SNOMED codes included in each code cluster are listed on [**OpenCodelists**](https://www.opencodelists.org/)

**SNOMED CT codes included in the GDPPR**
All releases of the clusters are available online via the NHS [**TRUD**]([https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud/users/guest/filters/0/home) (Technology Reference Update Distribution). UK LLC has downloaded Release 51.0.0<sup>3</sup> and made it available as a [downloadable text file](https://apply.ukllc.ac.uk/apply/view_document/gdppr).

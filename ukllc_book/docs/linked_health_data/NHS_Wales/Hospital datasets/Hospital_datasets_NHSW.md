## Introduction

The NHS Wales hospital datasets comprise the **Outpatients Database for Wales (OPDW)**, **Patient Episode Datasets for Wales (PEDW)**,  **Critical Care Datasets (CCDS)**, **Emergency Department datasets (EDDS)** and the **Intensive care case mix and activity (ICNC)**. The hospital datasets **do not include** all mental health or maternity-specific hospital activity.

**OPCS**, **ICD-10**, **NHS National** and **NHS Wales National codes** are used in the OPDW and PEDW datasets. See the [**Coded variables guide**](../Coding/coding_intro.md) for further details.

## Coverage of hospital datasets

The hospital datasets cover **inpatient admissions, outpatient appointments**, **critical care**, **Intensive care** and **accident & emergency attendances** at **hospitals in Wales**.

The hospital datasets **include** private patients treated in NHSW hospitals and care delivered by English Trusts.  
The hospital datasets were linked either by NHS number or a combination of alternative patient identifiable fields; **all five hospital datasets will be available in the UK LLC TRE**.

# NHS Wales primary care dataset
>Last modified: 12 Jul 2024

## Introduction

NHS Wales will flow extracts from the **Welsh Longitudinal General Practice Dataset (WLGP)** into the TRE.

## Coverage

The dataset covers 83% of the population of Wales and 80% of GP practices in Wales. 
Time coverage varies between each GP practice. 

## Content

Attendance and clinical information for all general practice interactions, including patientsâ€™ symptoms, investigations, diagnoses, prescribed medication and referrals. Most information is entered by the clinician during the patient consultation. Test results are electronically transferred from secondary care systems. 

Annual summary reports of key demographic metrics, updated quarterly, are available [**here**](https://docs.hiru.swan.ac.uk/display/SATP/WLGP+coverage+reports).

## Coding

The majority of clinicians use either **SNOMED-CT or Read Code** [**Terminology**](../../NHS_England/Coding/coding_intro.md), though sometimes these are applied behind the scenes by the clinical system.

## Further information
This page will be updated once more information about the structure of the WLGP data in the TRE is available.

More details on the WGLP dataset are available via the [**Health Data Research Gateway**](https://web.www.healthdatagateway.org/dataset/33fc3ffd-aa4c-4a16-a32f-0c900aaea3d2).

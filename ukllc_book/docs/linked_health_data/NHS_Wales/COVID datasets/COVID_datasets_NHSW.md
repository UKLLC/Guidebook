<sup>1</sup>As documented in the data sharing agreement.  
<sup>2</sup>As explained in the Department of Health and Social Care's (DHSC) [**COVID-19 Scaling up our testing programmes**](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5e888f05e90e0707799498b3/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-strategy.pdf), four pillars comprised the UK government's approach to testing for SARS-CoV-2.   
**Pillar 1** quantified the number of people with a clinical need, and health and care workers, who returned positive swab (antigen) tests (processed in PHE labs and NHS hospitals).  
**Pillar 2** quantified the number of people in the wider community who returned positive swab (antigen) tests (processed in commercial labs).  
**Pillar 3** quantified the number of people who returned positive serology (antibody) tests to detect immunity and to understand the efficacy of the different testing methods.   
**Pillar 4** quantified the number of people who returned positive serology (antibody) and swab (antigen) tests to detect immunity and to understand the efficacy of the different testing methods.

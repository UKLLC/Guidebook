# NHS Wales data
>Last modified: 19 Jun 2025
## Introduction  
**Data from NHS Wales will soon be available in the UK LLC TRE** - see details of the **17 datasets** in Table 1. 

Although NHS Wales is not the owner of all the datasets (acting as data controller or data processor on behalf of the owner for some), for ease, we refer to all the datasets in these guides as NHS Wales datasets.  

**Note**: Each LPS participant has the power to opt out of linkage to their NHS Wales records.  


## UK LLC documentation of NHS Wales datasets
We have organised our NHS Wales data documentation into four tiers as explained in Figure 1. This initial guide provides an overview of the NHS Wales datasets held in the UK LLC TRE. The **Processing and linkage guide** will explain how LPS participants are linked to their health records and how they can opt out. The **Coded variables guide** will detail the various classification systems used in NHS Wales datasets. The five **overview dataset guides** align with the dataset primary domains in Table 1 and provide an introduction to the hospital datasets, the COVID datasets, the registration datasets, the primary care dataset and the 'other' datasets, which is a collection of datasets that do not fit neatly into one of the other four groups. Finally, there is a series of more detailed **individual dataset guides**.

## Overview of NHS Wales datasets
The NHS Wales datasets cover a **variety of domains and time periods** as summarised in Table 1. Their **geographic coverage is restricted to Wales**, apart from ADDE. The UK LLC Data Team does **not change the names of the datasets** when they are ingested to the UK LLC TRE.

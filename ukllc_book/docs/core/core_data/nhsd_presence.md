# NHSD presence

>Last modified: 25 Jul 2024

CORE_NHSD_Presence_v0000_YYYYMMDD contains the number of appearances and the date of the most recent appearance for each participant for each available NHS data source in the UK LLC database. There is one row per participant. The table also includes a ‘last seen date’ for each participant as the most recent record across all NHS data sources. Some NHS data sources do not include record dates. Therefore the presence table may include the counts of each participant’s appearances in a data source without an associated date. 

**More details to be added shortly**

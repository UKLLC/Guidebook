# Denominator file 1

>Last modified: 25 Jul 2024

CORE_denominator_file1_v0000_YYYYMMDD has one row per UK LLC participant, the LPS to which they belong, and all UK LLC configurable permissions for the different domains of data. The date in the table/file name of the dataset relates to the file1 (permissions) that your project is fixed/locked to. Therefore participant permissions are correct and applied to your dataset as per this date. Permissions are updated by the LPS on a quarterly basis. This file allows users to:
* calculate linkage rates per LPS when joined to NHS demographics and other NHS datasets
* contextualise LPS participants within UK LLC in relation to the LPS datasets. 

**More details to be added shortly**
